We developed stage-based population models for each region of the CRC in AD Model Builder using dredge survey and harvest data provided by Maryland Department of Natural Resources from 1989 to 2015. Patterns in exploitation rates over time varied among regions. Abundance generally decreased during 1989-2003 and increased thereafter. Recruitment was greatest in the late 1990s, 2010, and 2012, which led to increases in abundance. Natural mortality was low across all regions during 2004-2015.

These efforts are widely constrained by the availability, cost, and suitability of substrates to support oyster settlement and reef establishment. In particular, oyster shell is often the preferred substrate but is relatively scarce and increasingly expensive. Thus, there is a need for alternative oyster restoration materials that are cost-effective, abundant, and durable. Methods: We tested the viability of two low-cost substrates-concrete and recycled blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) traps-in facilitating oyster recovery in a replicated 22-month field experiment at historically productive but now degraded intertidal oyster grounds on northwestern Florida's Nature Coast. Throughout the trial, we monitored areal oyster cover on each substrate; at the end of the trial, we measured the densities of oysters by size class (spat, juvenile, and market-size) and the biomass and volume of each reef. Results: Oysters colonized the concrete structures more quickly than the crab traps, as evidenced by significantly higher oyster cover during the first year of the experiment. By the end of the experiment, the concrete structures hosted higher densities of spat and juveniles, while the density of market-size oysters was relatively low and similar between treatments. The open structure of the crab traps led to the development of larger-volume reefs, while oyster biomass per unit area was similar between treatments. In addition, substrates positioned at lower elevations (relative to mean sea level) supported higher oyster abundance, size, and biomass than those less frequently inundated at higher elevations. Discussion: Together, these findings indicate that both concrete and crab traps are viable substrates for oyster reef restoration, especially when placed at lower intertidal elevations conducive to oyster settlement and reef development.",2/25/19,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,e6488,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000459588900008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53KYFVLC,journalArticle,2019,"Theuerkauf, Seth J.; Eggleston, David B.; Puckett, Brandon J.",Integrating ecosystem services considerations within a GIS-based habitat suitability index for oyster restoration,Plos One,,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0210936,,"Geospatial habitat suitability index (HSI) models have emerged as powerful tools that integrate pertinent spatial information to guide habitat restoration efforts, but have rarely accounted for spatial variation in ecosystem service provision.

We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, 'Metapopulation Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical(e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the 'Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for 'Metapopulation Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., ""win-win"" locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., ""tradeoff"" locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts.

Overharvesting, destructive fishing practices, and environmental degradation have caused significant declines in global oyster populations, necessitating restoration efforts in many regions to rebuild oyster habitat and recover lost services. Understanding how biological and physical gradients regulate oyster recruitment, survivorship and growth will help guide future efforts to successfully restore oyster populations. We conducted a field experiment in Ipswich, Massachusetts, to quantify the effects of tidal elevation, predator exclusion, and reef vertical relief on oyster settlement, recruitment and survivorship. Oyster settlement was 3 times greater at the deepest intertidal elevation compared to the 2 shallower intertidal elevations. Reef vertical relief and predator exclusion did not affect oyster settlement or survivorship. Despite increased sedimentation and algal fouling with increasing depth, living oyster densities remained significantly elevated at the deepest intertidal elevation 8 mo after the experimental reefs were constructed. Oyster mortality during this period was highest (>70%) at our shallowest elevation treatment, likely the result of desiccation and food limitation. Meanwhile, mortality during the first winter post-recruitment was high across all elevations (all >64 %), with our deepest elevation treatment experiencing the highest mortality rate (90%). Our results suggest that there is a gradient in oyster settlement rates, which increase at lower elevation, and that the dominant drivers of mortality also likely vary with elevation.

The present study provides new information on the distribution, condition, and ecology of the intertidal reefs, and assessed the general utility of high-resolution satellite imagery for routine monitoring of the extent and condition of intertidal oysters. Using online, freely available color imagery and manual interpretation, a total of 782 individual reefs ranging in size from similar to 3 m(2) to 3.9 ha (= 9.7 acres) and covering a total of 94 ha (233 ac) of bottom area were mapped. Field inspection and sampling of 100 individual intertidal reefs on November 12-16. 2016, confirmed wide differences in the number and areal coverage of reefs in the three major geographic regions in the Bay: 433 reefs covering a total of 56 ha (139 acres) in the western area (St. Vincent Sound); 113 reefs covering 8 ha (19 acres) in the central area; and 236 reefs covering 30 ha (75 acres) in the eastern area (St. George Sound). Most reefs in the western portion of the bay consisted of recently dead (""box"") oysters in all size classes, suggesting a recent massive mortality event. Mean densities (all size classes combined) of live oysters in the central and eastern areas were 42.9/m(2) (+/- 7.39; 1 SE) and 99.3/m(2) (+/- 13.22; 1 SE), respectively, with an overall mean shell height of 23.6 nun. Size-frequency histograms indicated only two year classes of live oysters, and the largest oyster collected was 84 mm. Although detailed quantitative comparisons with subtidal reefs were not possible, data from the present study suggest that intertidal reefs cover much less bottom area of the bay, but may contain much higher live oyster densities.

Species with the greatest clearance rates and population carrying capacity were also considered for their restoration and enhancement potential. Compared with eastern oysters, several additional species of saltwater bivalves and freshwater mussels are reported to filter water at rates that merit restoration attention and have been shown to attain significant population sizes. More work is needed to estimate system-carrying capacity and to eliminate restoration bottlenecks for some species-all bivalve species have constraints on their distribution and abundance.

Oyster reefs provide habitat and refuge for organisms, improve water quality, and decrease erosion. Oyster restoration projects aim to construct reefs that function similarly to their natural counterparts. Therefore, post-creation monitoring of these reefs is crucial in determining restoration success. However, monitoring is often lacking or focused only on oyster density and size rather than ecosystem functions such as nekton utilization. This study examines nekton utilization among created reefs compared to natural reefs in an estuary in Wilmington, North Carolina. The objective was to determine whether the created reefs function similarly to the natural reefs in abundance, species richness, and fish size. Using seine nets and Breder traps, reefs were sampled over a 5-month period. No significant difference was detected among reefs for nekton abundance, species richness, and standard length.

Oyster restoration, in particular, faces threats from alterations in precipitation, warming water temperatures, and urbanization of coastlines that dramatically change salinity patterns, foster the proliferation and spread disease, and disrupt habitat connectivity, respectively. New York City (NYC) coastal waters, once home to a booming oyster fishery for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), are now nearly devoid of live oyster reefs. Oyster restoration in urban estuaries is motivated by the synergistic ecosystem benefits this native keystone species can deliver. Recent surveys have documented substantial remnant populations of adult oysters in the upper low salinity zone of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary (HRE) near Tarrytown, NY. This study assessed fitness-related performance across the HRE salinity gradient to evaluate habitat suitability on an estuarine scale. Oysters were hatchery-produced from wild, moderate-salinity broodstock, then outplanted for measurement of growth, survival, reproduction and disease prevalence over two years. Survival was generally higher in the lower salinity river sites and in the higher salinity Jamaica Bay sites relative to mesohaline NYC harbor sites. Growth rate was highest in Jamaica Bay and had high variation among other sites. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of individuals with sex-differentiated gametes and the highest average gonad maturation index was found at a low salinity site. Consistent with the advanced gametogenesis measured in experimental animals at low salinity, annual wild recruitment was documented near the low salinity remnant population in each of five monitored years. These results suggest that the remnant HRE oyster population is a robust, self-sustaining population that can be leveraged to support restoration of subpopulations in other parts of the estuary, but further research is required to determine if the mesohaline and near-ocean reaches of the HRE can support the full oyster life cycle.",11/16/18,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,e0207368,,11,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450420900029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2F5CCJGL,journalArticle,2018,"Grizzle, Raymond E.; Rasmussen, Anna; Martignette, A.

Oysters and resident and transient fishes and crustaceans were monitored at the restored reef as well as at nearby natural oyster reef and unrestored bottom (i.e., dense mud with shell hash) habitats for two years following reef construction.

However, the principles of habitat quality, ecological connectivity and broader ecosystem management are poorly integrated within oyster reef restoration ecology, but such principles may be instructive in enhancing the benefits of projects on fish populations throughout estuarine seascapes. This manuscript presents a framework for projects seeking to restore both oyster reef habitat and finfish communities. Structurally and biologically complex oyster reefs, comprising both oysters and other invertebrates, are required to provide shelter, food and nursery services to fish. By carefully considering site selection at seascape scales (km to 10s of km), restoration can enhance the network of habitat available to fish and potentially increase the overall carrying capacity of the estuary. Managers of estuaries that now include restored oyster reefs should implement fisheries management plans and consider the effects of management actions broadly throughout catchments; failing to do so may jeopardize gains in fish yields. Management decisions must be adaptable, responding to key criteria in thorough monitoring programs.

Oyster populations have declined dramatically due to overharvesting, habitat loss, and disease. As restoration efforts and aquaculture of oysters continue to increase throughout their range, it is important to consider the impacts of a number of potential oyster pests, including the boring sponge Cliona spp. and the pea crab Zaops (Pinnotheres) ostreum, on oyster populations. Both of these have been demonstrated to reduce oyster growth, condition, and in some instances, reproductive output. Boring sponges in particular are a major concern for oyster growers and managers. Our monitoring efforts have suggested that pea crabs might be more prevalent in sponge-infested oysters; we therefore conducted an observational study to determine if there was any relationship between pea crab prevalence and sponge presence, and to examine whether the presence of both pests had synergistic effects on oyster condition. At 2 very different sample sites, North Carolina and New Jersey, oysters with 1 pest (i.e. boring sponge) were significantly more likely to have the second pest (i.e. pea crab) than the background population. Furthermore, sponge presence negatively affected oyster condition in North Carolina only, while pea crabs significantly reduced condition at both locations. When sponges and pea crabs were present together, the effects on oyster condition were additive.

We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based HSI for restoring persistent high-relief subtidal oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs protected from harvest (i.e., sanctuaries) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. Expert stakeholder input identified 17 factors to include in the HSI. Factors primarily represented physical (e.g., salinity) and biological (e.g., larval dispersal) processes relevant to oyster restoration, but also included several relevant permitting (e.g., presence of seagrasses) and logistical (e.g., distance to restoration material stockpile sites) considerations. We validated the model with multiple years of oyster density data from existing sanctuaries, and compared HSI output with distributions of oyster reefs from the late 1800's. Of the 17 factors included in the model, stakeholders identified four factors-salinity, larval export from existing oyster sanctuaries, larval import to existing sanctuaries, and dissolved oxygen-most critical to oyster sanctuary site selection. The HSI model provided a quantitative scale over which a vast water body (similar to 6,000 km(2)) was narrowed down by 95% to a much smaller suite of optimal (top 1% HSI) and suitable (top 5% HSI) locations for oyster restoration. Optimal and suitable restoration locations were clustered in northeast and southwest Pamlico Sound. Oyster density in existing sanctuaries, normalized for time since reef restoration, was a positive exponential function of HSI, providing validation for the model.

Here, we characterize the boat wake climate in the Intracoastal Waterway, assess the bathymetry in this heavily trafficked area, and anticipate the effects of experimental living shorelines (natural breakwall and oyster restoration structures) on facilitating sediment deposition and slowing vegetation retreat. Field observations indicate that boat wakes suspend nearshore sediment and can reach heights greater than 40 cm.

The desired porosity for minimizing lateral displacement is 0.50, while it is 0.18 for maximum energy dissipation, which indicates a need to further investigate this complex problem.

Fossil assemblages were studied from five Pleistocene sites located in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Reconstructions of paleosalinity and temperature were used to identify modern and colonial sites with similar environmental parameters for comparison. Shell height and life span in Chesapeake Bay oysters declined significantly from the Pleistocene to today, at the same time that ontogenetic growth rates have increased. This pattern is driven by age truncation, in which both harvesting and disease preferentially remove the larger, reproductively more active and primarily female members of the population. By contrast, Pleistocene oysters from North Carolina did not differ significantly, in shell height, life span, or growth rates, from modern oysters. Although oyster management in the Mid-Atlantic States has focused historically on protecting and supplementing early life stages, this study recommends three potential management solutions to the age truncation revealed by comparison with Pleistocene oysters.

Here we developed and simulated an epidemiological model describing sympatric oyster Crassostrea virginica populations in aquaculture and the wild impacted by the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus. Our model captured the indirect interaction between wild and cultured populations that occurs through sharing water-borne P. marinus transmission stages, and we hypothesized that oyster aquaculture can enhance wild oyster populations through reduced parasitism as long as cultured oysters are harvested prior to spreading disease. We found that the density of oysters in aquaculture, which is commonly thought to lead to the spread of disease through farms and out to nearby populations in the wild, has only indirect effects on P. marinus transmission through its interaction with the rate of aquaculture harvests.

Changes in surface elevation were related to MSL trends. Decade-old reefs achieved 2cm/year growth, which occurred along higher elevations when MSL increased. Young reefs experienced peak growth (6.7cm/year) at a lower elevation that coincided with a drop in MSL. The natural reef exhibited considerable loss during the low MSL of the first time step but grew substantially during higher MSL through the second time step, with growth peaking (4.3cm/year) at MSL, reoccupying the elevations previously lost. Oyster reefs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium with short-term (month-to-year) fluctuations in sea level, evidencing notable resilience to future changes to sea level that surpasses other coastal biogenic habitat types.

We tested the effects of antibiotics on mortality after a pathogen challenge in the Poecilia sphenops black molly and subsequently tested if probiotic inoculations could reverse any antibiotic-induced losses of disease resistance.

We contrasted the interaction strength between stone crabs and fouled and non-fouled oysters by comparing the parameters of fitted functional response curves based on Rogers random predation model. We found that fouled oysters suffered higher predation from stone crabs, and that the increased predation risk stemmed from a reduction in the handling time needed to consume the fouled oysters. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the effects of abiotic changes on both the composition of ecological communities, and on the strengths of direct and indirect interactions among species. Global climate change is altering local ecosystems in complex ways, and the success of restoration, management, and mitigation strategies for important species requires a better appreciation for how these effects cascade through ecosystems.",10/19/17,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,e3911,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000413260600003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FVCM9IBU,journalArticle,2017,"Hanke, Marc H.; Posey, Martin H.; Alphin, Troy D.",The effects of intertidal oyster reef habitat characteristics on faunal utilization,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,0171-8630,10.3354/meps12261,,"The presence, abundance, and distribution of organisms within a landscape are highly dependent on the composition, quality, and configuration of habitat patches. Intertidal oyster Crassostrea virginica reefs provide a structured habitat for many organisms; however, declining oyster populations have induced reef fragmentation and loss. Over 2 years (2011-2012), we evaluated naturally occurring fringing and patch intertidal oyster reefs in southeastern North Carolina, USA, to determine how varied reef type, size, and distance from edge to interior influenced the associated benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton. In addition, the effects of size and edge vs. interior were examined on constructed intertidal reefs at 2 different locations. On the natural reefs, species richness of benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton were significantly increased on fringing reefs. Benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased on large natural reefs, whereas mobile nekton richness significantly increased off of large reefs. Further, associated benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased along the reef edge, whereas mobile nekton diversity increased along the reef/open bottom interface. Species richness and densities for benthic macrofauna increased with created reef size, while there was greater species richness and diversity and dissimilar communities for mobile nekton along constructed reef edges. Habitat specificity may influence utilization for mobile nekton, as resident organisms with limited vagility had a stronger response to habitat characteristics.

Our model results indicate that resident fish biomass is directly affected by oyster restoration and oyster biomass, and oyster restoration can have cascading impacts on transient fish biomass. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of a favorable oyster population growth rate during early restoration years, as it can lead to rapid increases in mean oyster biomass and biomass of transient fish species. The model also revealed that a transient fish's diet solely dependent on oyster reef-derived prey could limit the biomass of transient fish species, emphasizing the importance of habitat connectivity in estuarine areas to enhance transient fish species biomass.

Furthermore, the heritable nature of many of those modifications constitutes a very promising avenue to explore the applicability of epigenetic conditioning and selection in management and restoration strategies.

Created reef success depends entirely on selecting a location that supports long-term oyster growth and survival, including the recruitment and survival of on-reef oysters. Significant changes in estuarine salinity through management of freshwater inflows and through changed precipitation patterns may significantly impact the locations of optimal oyster restoration sites. These rapid shifts in conditions necessitate a need to better understand both impacts to on-reef oyster growth and population development, and variation in oyster stock performance. Oyster growth, mortality, condition, and disease prevalence were examined in three different stocks of oysters located in protected cages, as well as oyster recruitment and mortality on experimental reef units in three different locations representing a salinity gradient, along the Louisiana Gulf coast in 2011 and 2012. Over a 2-y period, the high-salinity site had highest oyster growth rate in protected cages but demonstrated the least likelihood for reef development based on on-reef oyster population failure, likely because of predation-related mortality (high recruitment and 100% mortality). In contrast, the midsalinity site with moderate oyster growth and on-reef recruitment and low mortality demonstrated a higher likelihood for reef development. The lowest salinity site exhibited extreme variability in all oyster responses between years because of extreme variation in environmental conditions during the study, indicating a low likelihood of long-term reef development. Whereas limited differences in stock performance between sites were found, the range of site environmental conditions tested was ultimately much lower than expected and may not have provided a wide enough range of conditions. In areas with limited, low recruitment, or rapidly changing environmental conditions, seeding with stocks selected for best growth and survival under expected future environmental conditions could better ensure reef development by using oyster populations best suited to the predicted conditions.

Furthering our understanding of how these habitats are evolving in the face of anthropogenic and climate driven changes will help improve management strategies. Previous work has shown that the growth and productivity of both oyster reefs and salt marshes are strongly linked to elevation in the intertidal zone (duration of aerial exposure). We build on that research by examining the growth of marsh-fringing oyster reefs at yearly to decadal time scales and examine movement of the boundary between oyster reef and salt marsh at decadal to centennial time scales. We show that the growth of marsh-fringing reefs is strongly associated to the duration of aerial exposure, with little growth occurring below mean low water and above mean sea level. Marsh-shoreline movement, in the presence or absence of fringing oyster reefs, was reconstructed using transects of sediment cores. Carbonaceous marsh sediments sampled below the modern fringing oyster reefs indicate that marsh shorelines within Back Sound, North Carolina are predominantly in a state of transgression (landward retreat), and modern oyster-reef locations were previously occupied by salt marsh within the past two centuries. Cores fronting transgressive marsh shorelines absent fringing reefs sampled thinner and less extensive carbonaceous marsh sediment than at sites with fringing reefs. This indicates that fringing reefs are preserving carbonaceous marsh sediment from total erosion as they transgress and colonize the exposed marsh shoreline making marsh sediments more resistant to erosion. The amount of marsh sediment preservation underneath the reef scales with the reef's relief, as reefs with the greatest relief were level with the marsh platform, preserving a maximum amount of carbonaceous sediments during transgression by buffering the marsh from erosional processes. Thus, fringing oyster reefs not only have the capacity to shelter shorelines but, if located at the ideal tidal elevation, they also keep up with accelerating sea-level rise and cap carbonaceous sediments, protecting them from erosion, as reefs develop along the marsh.",2017-07,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,1013-1027,,4,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000402100700007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5U3C2DN5,journalArticle,2017,"Hijuelos, Ann Commagere; Sable, Shaye E.; O'Connell, Ann M.; Geaghan, James P.; Lindquist, David C.; White, Eric D.",Application of Species Distribution Models to Identify Estuarine Hot Spots for Juvenile Nekton,Estuaries and Coasts,,1559-2723,10.1007/s12237-016-0199-5,,"Modeling the distribution and habitat capacities of key estuarine species can be used to identify hot spots, areas where species density is significantly higher than surrounding areas.

The regions identified as hot spots were productive fringing marsh habitats that are considered the most vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic impacts.

To document the spreading distribution of green crabs, we carried out surveys in seven sites of Prince Edward Island during three fall seasons. To assess the potential impact of green crabs on oyster mortality in relation to predator and prey size, we conducted multiple predator-prey manipulations in the field and laboratory. The surveys confirmed an ongoing green crab spread into new productive oyster habitats while rapidly increasing in numbers in areas where crabs had established already. The experiments measured mortality rates on four sizes of oysters exposed to three sizes of crab, and lasted 3-5 days. The outcomes of experiments conducted in Vexar bags, laboratory tanks and field cages were consistent and were heavily dependent on both crab size and oyster size: while little predation occurred on large oysters, large and medium green crabs preyed heavily on small sizes. Oysters reached a refuge within the 35-55 mm shell length range; below that range, oysters suffered high mortality due to green crab predation and thus require management measures to enhance their survival. These results are most directly applicable to aquaculture operations and restoration initiatives but have implications for oyster sustainability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The physical reef structure and associated biotic parameters can affect the availability of food resources for oysters. Oysters and potential composite food sources - suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) - were assessed using a dual stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) approach at three reef types (natural, restored, and unconsolidated) seasonally for two years to determine if changes in physical and/or biotic parameters affected the relative availability and/or use of food resources by oysters. SPOM was more depleted in C-13 (-24.2 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, mean +/- SD) than SSOM (-21.2 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand). SPOM composition is likely dominated by autochthonous phytoplankton production, while SSOM includes trapped phytoplankton and benthic microalgae. SSOM was used by oysters in increasing proportions relative to SPOM over time at all reef types. This temporal trend is likely due to increased oyster biomass over time, promoting enhanced microphytobenthos growth through feedback effects related to oyster biodeposits. Structural differences between reef types observed in this study had no effect on food resource availability and use by oysters, indicating strong bentho-pelagic coupling likely due to shallow depths as well as strong and consistent winds. This study provides insights for restoration of oyster reefs as it highlights that food resources used by oysters remain similar among reef types despite changes in abiotic and biotic parameters among habitats and over time.

Further complicating the issue, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence are also expected to affect estuarine water quality. In this study, we developed a process-based numerical modeling system that couples hydrodynamic, water quality, and oyster population dynamics. We selected Breton Sound Estuary (BSE) (similar to 2740 km(2)) in the eastern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain since it is home to several of the largest public oyster seed grounds and private leases for the Gulf coast. The coupled oyster population model was calibrated and validated against field observed oyster growth data. We predicted the responses of oyster population in BSE to small-(142 m(3) s(-1)) and large-scale (7080 m(3) s(-1)) river diversions at the Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure planned in the 2012 Coastal Master Plan (Louisiana) under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative sea-level rise (RSLR=eustatic SLR+subsidence) compared to a baseline condition (Year 2009). Model results showed that the large-scale diversion had a stronger negative impact on oyster population dynamics via freshening of the entire estuary, resulting in reduced oyster growth rate and production than RSLR. Under the large-scale diversion, areas with optimal oyster growth rates (>15 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) oyster(-1) wk(-1)) and production (>500 g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)) would shift seaward to the southeastern edge of the estuary, turning the estuary into a very low oyster production system. RSLR however played a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of oyster growth rate and production. RSLR would result in an overall estuary-wide decrease in oyster growth rate and production as a consequence of decreased salinities in the middle and lower estuary because rising sea level likely causes increased stage and overbank flow downstream along the lower Mississippi River.

Density and recruitment patterns suggested differences between edge and interior locations. However, other population characteristics, such as oyster condition and shell height, indicated there may be ecological trade-offs among the habitat characteristics examined.

Near to the substratum interface, however, larval preferences and boundary flow may be overriding influences. Restored oyster reefs are intended to provide substrata for sessile hard-fouling organisms such as barnacles, but the optimal configuration to encourage larval settlement has not yet been determined. Two common restoration strategies involve cultch, the shell material for reef restoration, in bags or on mats. Bags constitute quick, stackable construction with cultch packed haphazardly and limited space between shells. Mats utilize cultch sparingly and keep shells more exposed to currents. Although both restoration strategies are widely used, data comparing larval settlement between bags and mats are unavailable. We followed daily larval supply of the ivory barnacle Balanus eburneus (Gould, 1841) and corresponding settlement on cultch presented in bags and mats in a field study lasting one month in an estuary in eastern Florida, USA. Consideration was also given to the effect of substratum orientation (upward-facing, downward-facing, or vertical). Recruitment densities of B. eburneus were as great as 7.6 +/- 0.54 SE individuals cm (2), and higher on mats than in bags (P = 0.0001). Orientation of the substratum also influenced recruitment, with greater settlement on downward-facing and vertical oyster shells presented on mats (P = 0.037), which were more open to boundary flow.

We investigated wave effects on communities at these reefs by comparing species composition, relative abundance, and species morphology on windward versus leeward sides. In addition, acorn barnacles Amphibalanus eburneus were used as biological indicators of flow because they develop larger basal diameters and shorter feeding appendages in faster flows. Waves were higher and current speed was faster on the windward sides of oyster reefs. Leeward sites had a greater abundance and diversity of species. Brachyuran crabs were significantly larger and more abundant when shielded from waves. Porcelain crabs Petrolisthes armatus were smaller and, in contrast to brachyuran crabs, more abundant at windward sites. Windward sites had fewer fish species though there was no difference in the size of fish found on either side of the reef. Barnacles settling in late spring had larger basal diameters but relatively shorter feeding appendages in windward areas, compared to leeward areas; these morphological differences mirrored ADV measurements, verified long-term differences in flow and were indicative of bigger waves and higher flow velocities in windward locations.

These highly productive, physically demanding ecosystems are populated by core species groups that often have strong trophic interactions with implications for ecosystem function and service provision. Positive interactions occur between ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) and cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Mussels transfer particulate nitrogen from the water column to the marsh sediments, which stimulates cordgrass growth, and cordgrass provides predator and/or heat stress refuge for mussels. Here, we test mussel facilitation of two functions in salt marshes that relate to N removal: microbial denitrification and water filtration. Microcosm experiments revealed that the highest rates of N-2 production and nitrification occurred when mussels were present with marsh vegetation, suggesting that mussels enhanced coupling of the nitrification-denitrification. Surveys spanning the York River Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, showed that the highest densities of mussels occurred in the first meter for all marsh types with mainstem fringing (1207 +/- 265 mussels/m(2)) being the most densely populated. The mussel population was estimated to be similar to 197 million animals with a water filtration potential of 90-135 million L/hr. Erosion simulation models demonstrated that suitable marsh habitat for ribbed mussels along the York River Estuary would be reduced by 11.8% after 50 years. This reduction in mussel habitat resulted in a projected 15% reduction in ribbed mussel abundance and filtration capacity. Denitrification potential was reduced in conjunction with projected marsh loss (35,536 m(2)) by 205 g N/hr, a 16% reduction.

Effective restoration requires an understanding of the distribution, density, and demographic rates (growth and survival) of oysters inhabiting existing natural reefs and how these may vary as a function of landscape-scale factors, such as tidal range and fetch distances. Furthermore, natural intertidal habitats are increasingly being replaced with hardened shoreline structures that may be colonized by oysters, yet little is known about habitat quality (as indexed by oyster density and demographic rates) of these hardened structures relative to natural habitats. The present study sought to compare oyster density, demographic rates, and population estimates (1) across estuarine landscape settings to inform natural intertidal oyster reef restoration (i. e., comparing natural intertidal reefs within adjacent water bodies that vary in tidal regimes and fetch distances) and (2) across natural habitats and human-made structures to assess variation in habitat quality between natural reefs and hardened shorelines. Oyster density, growth rates, and population estimates on natural intertidal reefs were greatest within the smaller, more tidally influenced Core Sound versus the larger, wind-driven Pamlico Sound, with no significant difference in survivorship identified between the two water bodies. Natural intertidal reefs and hardened shoreline structures were compared within Pamlico Sound only, with natural intertidal reefs hosting three to eight times higher oyster densities than hardened shoreline structures. When mean oyster density/ m 2 was multiplied by reef area to estimate population size, natural intertidal reefs within Pamlico Sound hosted considerably greater populations of oysters relative to hardened shorelines.

The feeding behavior of the bivalves was studied using in situ filter-feeding devices and the biodeposition method in the 3 basins of the IRL during March and August 2015. Water characteristics (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chl a, and total, organic, and inorganic particulates) were related to possible changes in the feeding physiology of the bivalves. Oysters had higher clearance rates, filtration rates, and rejection than clams. The high rejection of inorganic matter allowed oysters to increase the organic matter ingested, leading to high absorption efficiencies. In contrast, because clam rejection was low regardless of elevated levels of inorganic matter, their absorption efficiency only increased with higher organic matter content. Both species preferred higher salinities, and the amount of organic matter in the water had a negative relationship with some feeding parameters (filtration rate for both species, and rejection for oysters). Acute environ mental change brought about by a brown tide (caused by the alga Aureoumbra lagunensis) also affected these 2 bivalve species differently, supporting the hypothesis that oysters and clams have different physiological capabilities that drive their ability to survive in dynamic estuarine ecosystems.",3/13/17,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,125-137,,,567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000397823100009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FNULBH8X,journalArticle,2017,"Theuerkauf, Seth J.; Eggleston, David B.; Puckett, Brandon J.; Theuerkauf, Kathrynlynn W.","Wave Exposure Structures Oyster Distribution on Natural Intertidal Reefs, But Not on Hardened Shorelines",Estuaries and Coasts,,1559-2723,10.1007/s12237-016-0153-6,,"Intertidal oyster reefs can protect estuarine shorelines from wave erosion and sea-level rise, and recognition of these ecosystem services has fueled global efforts to conserve and restore these reefs.

A clear shift in restored reef community composition occurred 12-15 months after restoration, moving from a community dominated by opportunistic species to a more diverse and evenly distributed community, similar to that of the natural reef. Consumer stable isotope values indicated that the restored reef community was supported by similar food resources and had similar food chain length as the natural reef community by 5-month post-restoration. However, biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices indicated that the magnitude of the main trophic pathways and characteristics of food web complexity in the restored reef did not recover to natural reef levels until 12-15 months after construction. The functional recovery of the restored reef community was driven by the homogenization of biomass distribution among trophic compartments as oysters and top predators increasingly colonized the reef.

The objectives of this study were therefore to compare the mortality, growth, dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infection intensity and condition index of the progeny of wild oysters collected from three Louisiana estuaries differing in salinity regime and oysters specifically selected for dermo resistance. Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding.

Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40% tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40% tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.",12/29/16,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,113-122,,,562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000394183600009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7A7PCGYC,journalArticle,2016,"Kulp, Rebecca E.; Peterson, Bradley J.",EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF MESOPREDATORS ON OYSTER RESTORATION IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN REGION,Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.035.0408,,"Predation of newly settled juvenile Cras'sostrea virginica often dominates post-settlement mortality. Resident mesopredators such as the xanthid mud crabs are abundant (>200/m(2)) on constructed subtidal oyster reefs in the New York metropolitan region and may contribute to post-settlement oyster mortality. Two study sites with differing mesopredator species, Hastings and Soundview Park, were selected to examine the role of small crustacean predators in post settlement mortality. The white-fingered mud crab (Rhithropanopeus horrisii) inhabits Hastings, whereas the flat mud crab (Eurvpanopeus depressus) and Sayi niud crab (Dyspanopeus sari) inhabit Soundview Park. Using size-selective mesh cages to exclude predators, the effects of predator size on oyster predation and recruitment at Hastings and Soundview Park were examined. Overall, Sound view Park had higher consumption rates than Hastings. The highest consumption at Soundview Park occurred when predators of all sizes had access to the oyster prey. Larger-sized predators were likely responsible for oyster mortality, as oyster mortality was not different between the mesopredator and no-predator treatment at Soundview Park. Few oysters recruited at Soundview Park: thus predator size effects on oyster recruitment could not be effectively evaluated between sites. Recruitment at Hastings was not affected by predator-exclusion treatments, in agreement with the oyster predation experiments. Though abundant, no mud crab mesopredator recovered at either site was greater than 22 mm in carapace width. Mesopredators were likely not of sufficient size to be dominant predators of newly settled juvenile oysters at Hastings and Soundview Park. Instead, predation pressure at Soundview Park was likely due to larger mobile predators such as blue (Callinccics sapidus) and spider crabs (Libinia spp.). Mesopredator size is an important factor to consider when evaluating mesopredator roles on oyster reefs.",2016-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,801-807,,4,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000398959000008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RCFL7W8A,journalArticle,2016,"Fisch, Nicholas C.; Pine, William E.","A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRESHWATER DISCHARGE AND OYSTER FISHERY CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT IN APALACHICOLA BAY, FLORIDA: AN EVALUATION FROM 1960 TO 2013",Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.035.0409,,"Freshwater input is mught to be a critical factor influencing estuaries through multiple direct and indirect pathways. In this study, findings of a key 1992 paper on Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery data and Apalachicola River discharge data from 1960 to 1984 were recreated, and the analysis extended to 1987 to 2013, to evaluate whether relationships previously reported between river discharge and oyster fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) persist. The originally reported relationship between low river discharge and lower oyster landings 2 y later was confirmed, but when these same relationships for data from 1987 to 2013 were examined, correlation coefficients relating river discharge metrics to oyster fishery CPUE that were significant with 1960 to 1984 data did not persist with data from 1987 to 2013. Combining all available data (1960 to 2013, excluding 1985 to 1986), previously reported significant correlation coefficients were found to have generally persisted or strengthened and the total number of significant correlations increased. A surprising result is the general lack of association between river discharge and oyster fishery landings from 1987 to 2013, a period of frequent drought and generally lower annual river discharge compared with 1960 to 1984. There are multiple possible explanations for the observed relationships between river discharge and oyster fishery landings including ( l) counterintuitive changes in oyster fishery landings due to a change in reporting requirements between the two epochs, (2) hyperstable relationship between oyster abundance and fishery CPI; E, (3) failure of the Apalachicola Bay oyster population to recover after Hurricane Elena, and (4) ecosystem changes possibly related to nonstationary river discharge levels altering Apalachicola River or Bay ecosystem dynamics in unknown ways.

To identify suitable areas for oyster restoration and aquaculture, areas of oyster suitable habitat must first be identified. A habitat suitability model is an ideal tool for identifying sites for species restoration. Because it relies on presence-only data, MaxEnt is a particularly useful habitat-suitability model for identifying restoration and species introduction sites. Habitat suitability models rely on the selection of environmental factors, which are assumed to be important for the target species; however, this selection of environmental factors is often arbitrary and there are few existing guidelines. This work applies an oyster habitat suitability model to the St. Louis Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Six environmental factors, namely average salinity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, water depth, minimum dissolved oxygen, and average total suspended solids were chosen to simulate habitat suitability. The environmental factors were obtained from a calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model of the estuary. The habitat suitability model was run with every possible combination of environmental factors, including one, two, three, four, five, and six inputs. Model results showed that at this location, salinity is the most important environmental input. Furthermore, model results showed that increasing the number of inputs optimizes model results. There is a diminishing return on the addition of environmental factors and there is a point at which the continued addition of environmental factors will not continue to notably improve model optimization. The ranges of simulated suitable values for the environmental factors were contextualized within measured values. This study shows how a statistical model can he used to identify restoration locations. It is a particularly compelling methodology because (1) it does not require prior information regarding suitable ranges of environmental factors; (2) it does not require information regarding the level of importance for those environmental factors; (3) it requires presence-only data; (4) results are based on spatiotemporal data at a finer scale than is generally measured in the field: and (5) model results can provide an additional line of evidence that complements knowledge by biologists and oystermen.",2016-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,841-849,,4,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000398959000012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TGJEYDPE,journalArticle,2016,"Savarese, Michael; Walker, Karen J.; Stingu, Shanna; Marquardt, William H.; Thompson, Victor",The effects of shellfish harvesting by aboriginal inhabitants of Southwest Florida (USA) on productivity of the eastern oyster: Implications for estuarine management and restoration,Anthropocene,,2213-3054,10.1016/j.ancene.2016.10.002,,"Oyster reefs in Southwest Florida (USA) have been integral to estuarine ecology throughout the Holocene.

A conservation paleobiological/historical ecological study of oysters from middens and modern reefs within Estero Bay (EB) and Pine Island Sound (PIS) determined if oyster productivity changed due to aboriginal overharvesting. Archaeological samples came from sites including the Late Archaic (LA, 2000-500 BC) of PIS and the Caloosahatchee (Cal, 500 BC-AD 1500) of EB and PIS. These samples were compared with natural oyster death assemblages from neighboring modern reefs. Methods comprised measuring oyster convex valve lengths and sectioning shells to count ligament pit growth lines that served as proxy for growth rate. The biologic taphonomic grade was also compared after scoring the interior valve surface; biologic grade is near pristine for oysters collected live for consumption. Archaeological samples exhibit significantly better taphonomic grades when compared to modern assemblages, confirming the hypothesis that oysters were harvested for food. Valve length decreased significantly from LA to Cal time, whereas modern assemblages were indistinguishable from LA collections. Because the Cal samples span 4 climatic intervals, the results suggest that climate change was not responsible for shifts in productivity. Results support the hypothesis of overharvesting during Cal times. They also suggest that modern oysters retain the capacity for growth, and indicate that aboriginal activity did not result in a permanent microevolutionary shift. The results are also relevant for the ongoing discussion surrounding the creation of an Anthropocene Epoch; the shell middens built throughout history greatly influenced both estuarine ecology and landscapes through fishing and engineering practices.

Experimental reefs consisting of live oysters, oyster shells alone and mudflats (controls) were sampled for a period of 4 wk for sediment organic matter, C and N content and fluxes of nitrogen (NH4+, NOX and N-2) and oxygen (O-2). We hypothesized that the biological activity of the oyster would deposit more, higher quality organic matter compared to deposition from flow modification alone, thus facilitating denitrification and having a larger impact on sediment nitrogen cycling. Compared to the controls, the live oyster experimental reefs increased sediment denitrification by 61% and the shell experimental reefs showed a 24% increase. The live oyster experimental reef also had the largest O-2 demand and NH4+ production. Reef structure likely increased organic matter deposition, but the higher quality and larger quantity of organic matter associated with live oysters increased denitrification and microbial respiration.

Nitrification was similar between live oysters and empty oyster shells, however, denitrification was enhanced significantly on living oysters compared to shells.

These distinct morphologies are thought to form by interactions of nascent reef structures with hydrodynamics. We carried out two field studies to determine if historical reef configurations applied in a restoration context would improve reef persistence and restoration outcomes. We collected seabed and water column observations across constructed reefs of three orientations representative of those found historically throughout the oyster's range: parallel or perpendicular to tidal currents or circular. Areas adjacent to reefs were sites of fine sediment trapping, with lower flow velocities, evidence of particle settling, and more fine sediments on the seabed relative to off-reef reference sites. The water column above the reef crest exhibited higher acoustic backscatter, higher flow velocities, and larger particles in suspension, consistent with local erosion of flocculated fine sediment from the reef crest. Perpendicular reefs produced conditions that were more conducive to reef persistence and improved oyster performance, including high flow velocities and enhanced resuspension of sediments from the reef, compared to parallel or circular reefs. Particle trapping in areas between reefs has the potential to inhibit reef growth between existing reef structures, providing support for hypotheses of landscape-scale reef pattern formation.

These die-off events have led to a conversion from shell to sandbar substrate and rapid loss of elevation (ca 8 cm/y). This process appears to be nonreversible, because oyster spat are unable to colonize sandy substrate. It is hypothesized that the addition of durable hard substrate would make reefs more resilient to periodic declines in freshwater flow by providing a persistent settlement site for extant larvae. This article reports a test of the assumption that oyster populations on these reefs are limited by substrate, and documents key effects on oysters, elevation, and avian usage associated with the addition of substrate. Durable substrate was added in the form of limerock cobbles and recycled clam Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758) aquaculture bags filled with cultch, live oysters, and associated fauna to eight paired treatment and control sites spaced along a highly degraded offshore reef chain. Elevation on treatment reefs increased postconstruction by an average of 16 cm. Mean oyster density on treatment sites increased by 2.653x on rock, 14.53x on clam bags, and 9.23x overall compared with control sites. Recycled clam bags contributed approximately 25% of the surface area on treatment reefs, but accounted for 52% of the oysters observed. Oyster densities on treatment sites were between 893 and 1253 those measured at a larger sample of nearby natural reefs, and exceeded the 89th percentile of reported densities at natural and restored reefs in the Gulf of Mexico. Total bird use was higher on treatment sites, but when controlled for elevation, all species but double-crested cormorants [Phalacrocorax auritus (Lesson, 1831)] and bald eagles [Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Linnaeus, 1766)] preferred control (sand bar) sites. These results indicate that (1) oyster recruitment can be strongly limited by available, durable substrate, especially in high-energy environments; (2) aquaculture byproduct materials can play a significant role in the process of restoration; and (3) restoration of oyster reefs and other living shorelines may have impacts on avian community composition.

The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use. Our results point to the need for better understanding of the ecological and human health risks of exposure to the diverse cocktail of pollutants and harmful compounds that will continue to leach from estuarine sediments over time.

Effective application of these concepts to marine reserves is limited by data on demographic rates within reserves and larval connectivity among reserves. Using a network of reserves established to restore eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA as our model system, we integrated empirically based demographic rates and regional hydrodynamic-based connectivity estimates within a metapopulation model to (1) evaluate the potential for the reserve network to function as a self-persistent oyster metapopulation, (2) determine the relative importance of demographics vs. connectivity on reserve source-sink dynamics, (3) assess the efficacy of stock enhancement in promoting metapopulation persistence, and (4) evaluate whether application of a Few Large or Several Small reserves-a modification of the Single Large or Several Small concept-promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae within the reserve network (i.e., local larval retention within reserves + larval connectivity among reserves). The reserve network failed to function as a self-persistent metapopulation, despite exceptional demographic rates within reserves. When considering only larval supply from reserves, local retention and connectivity were insufficient to provide annual replacement (>=similar to 0.25 recruits per adult). Accordingly, reserves contributed to the metapopulation primarily via production, not dispersal, of larvae and reserve source-sink dynamics were influenced more by demographics within reserves, particularly adult growth and survival, than larval connectivity among reserves. Addressing recruitment limitation via stock enhancement was not effective at augmenting projected metapopulation declines. Several small reserves initially promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae than a few large reserves, however, as the number or area of reserves increased, metapopulation retention was equivalent among designs, suggesting that Few Large and Several Small reserves may be the best network design.

Examining how genetic diversity relates to demographic traits provides a key mechanistic link from genotypic and phenotypic variation of taxa with complex life histories to their population dynamics. We conducted a field experiment to assess how two metrics of intraspecific diversity (cohort diversity, the number of independent juvenile cohorts created from different adult source populations, and genetic relatedness, genetic similarity among individuals within and across cohorts) affect the survivorship, growth, and recruitment of the foundation species Crassostrea virginica. To assess the effects of both cohort diversity and genetic relatedness on oyster demographic traits under different environmental conditions, we manipulated juvenile oyster diversity and predator exposure (presence/absence of a cage) at two sites differing in resource availability and predation intensity. Differences in predation pressure between sites over-whelmingly determined post-settlement survivorship of oysters. However, in the absence of predation (i.e., cage treatment), one or both metrics of intraspecific diversity, in addition to site, influenced long-term survivorship, growth, and recruitment. While both cohort diversity and genetic relatedness were negatively associated with long-term survivorship, genetic relatedness alone showed a positive association with growth and cohort diversity alone showed a positive association with recruitment. Thus, our results demonstrate that in the absence of predation, intraspecific diversity can affect multiple demographic traits of a foundation species, but the relative importance of these effects depends on the environmental context. Moreover, the magnitude and direction of these effects vary depending on the diversity metric, cohort diversity or genetic relatedness, suggesting that although they are inversely related in this system, each captures sufficiently different components of intraspecific diversity. Given the global loss of oyster reef habitat and rapid decline in oyster population size, our results are particularly relevant to management and restoration.

These habitats provide many services to humankind and, thus, much effort has been dedicated to their restoration. Here, we examine the efficacy of created oyster reefs at enhancing seagrass beds through the amelioration of hydrographic conditions and water quality. We carried out a field experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico where we compared areas shoreward of created reefs with adjacent reef-free areas over several years using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design. The reefs were built with oyster shell, measured 65 m, and were placed at circa 100 m from the shoreline to ensure subtidal conditions and enhance oyster recruitment. The BACI results showed few and disparate effects of the reefs, even when distance from the reef was factored in. However, we found a temporal increase in seagrass cover throughout all the experimental area (i.e. including both reef and control plots) following reef deployment. Interestingly, further analysis with satellite imagery showed the experimental area had higher seagrass cover 5 years after reef deployment than it did before reef deployment, but such increase was not observed for nearby areas. In concert, the results suggest ""shadow"" effects for the reefs examined, where positive effects on seagrass beds extend beyond the area directly shoreward from the reef.

A field trial was performed to investigate whether the remote set of oysters can be used to restock natural beds during mortalities caused by disease epizootics and lack of recruitment due to periods without sets. Disease-resistant oysters were remote set in a hatchery and placed either in or without biodegradable nets on a natural bed. Aged, clean cultch was used as the control, and the growth, mortality, predation, fouling, and prevalence of disease were monitored for two growing seasons. The oysters grew to market size (3 inches, 76.2 mm) in 15 mo. Predation, due mainly to Atlantic oyster drills Urosalpinx cinerea, and overgrowth of oysters caused a mortality of 72% in the oyster seed during the first growing season. More abundant wild oysters set but fewer fouling organisms landed on the remote-set shells than on the clean cultch. To evaluate the effect of siltation on mortality, the oysters were left on the natural bed instead of being transplanted to growing areas, as is standardly done in commercial shellfishing operations. During the second growing period, siltation caused additional mortality until only 1.5% of the oysters deployed were alive. The method of restocking natural beds in Connecticut with remote-set oyster seed for use by the oyster industry looks promising due to the fast growth of the oyster seed. This experiment also demonstrates the challenges presented by nonharvest oyster restoration activities due to significant siltation-associated mortality.",2016-04,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,115-125,,1,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000376743800013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KGKZED5Y,journalArticle,2016,"Ermgassen, Philine S.

Structured habitats serve as nursery grounds by enhancing juvenile fish and mobile crustacean survival and abundance. This service is challenging to quantify due to ontogenetic shifts in habitat use by many species. We reviewed available literature on the increased abundance of juvenile fish and mobile crustaceans in a key nursery habitat - Crassostrea virginica reefs in the USA. We modelled the growth and mortality of the enhanced species using three different natural mortality (M) estimates to provide estimates of the gross and net lifetime production and uncertainty that can be attributed to the habitat. Recruitment of nineteen and twelve species were found to be enhanced by the addition of C.virginica reefs to previously unstructured habitat in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic USA, respectively. This increased recruitment is estimated to result in a mean lifetime enhancement in production of 397115 (1SD) gm(-2)year(-1) in the Gulf of Mexico and 28156gm(-2)year(-1) in the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic. The two regions differed with regard to the identity of the enhanced species and their degree of augmentation. Thus, our results highlight the inadequacy of applying regional estimates of ecosystem services to global scales. Furthermore, estimates of total enhancement varied by up to a factor of 28 across the three methods of M estimation. Our estimates are quantitative predictions of the ecological benefits derived from the restoration or conservation of a threatened habitat, and advance the field of restoration science beyond qualitative statements that just predict direction of benefit (e.g. increased or decreased). Quantification of the uncertainty in the production estimates further increases their utility for decision-makers.Synthesis and applications. Our results can be applied to the restoration or conservation of nursery habitats where habitat is limiting the recruitment of fish species.

A common practice in areas of minimal spat set incorporates remote setting, a method of setting hatchery-reared larvae in tanks, and then transporting them to the field. Although remote setting is effective, inefficiencies exist. Repeated shell handling, spat mortality during transport, and decreased cultch supply suggest that other restoration methods merit consideration. We present the results of the first known field test of directly seeding a submerged oyster reef with larvae and setting an additional cohort on the reef the following year. We surrounded a 65 m(2) reef located in 2.5 m of water with a flexible enclosure and added 2.3 x 10(6) larvae. Larvae were allowed 3 d to set on either clean or fouled shell valves, after which we removed the enclosure. Setting efficiencies in the enclosure (spat produced per larvae introduced), were 26 and 7% for clean and fouled shell, respectively, in 2012, and 10 and 16% in 2013. These are comparable to published remote setting efficiencies, and were significantly higher than in our representative shoreside tank. Spat densities on site 1 mo post-set (median = 189 spat m(-2)) and the following spring (115 juveniles m(-2)) met best practice restoration metrics. Larvae were re-set on the reef in 2013, but in lower densities than 2012, supplementing the reef with 23 spat m(-2).

High relief reefs are more productive and resilient than low relief reefs, in part, because increasing reef height reduces sedimentation and enhances oyster growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between initial reef height and reef development using a simple model. The model contains three coupled differential equations that describe changes in oyster volume, shell volume, and sediment volume per unit area of reef with time. The model was used to investigate how parameters such as flow speed, sediment grain size, and food concentration affect reef survival and final reef height. Whether or not a reef survives depends primarily on the shape of the sediment concentration profile relative to the initial reef height. Over a long time period, three different steady-state reef heights are possible, depending on the environmental parameters and initial reef height: (1) If growth outpaces sedimentation, the reef achieves the maximum possible height, which is independent of sedimentation parameters; (2) if deposition outpaces growth and the shear stress does not exceed the critical shear stress, the reef is buried in sediment and dies; and (3) if deposition outpaces growth and the shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress, a reduced steady-state height is achieved that depends on both growth and sedimentation parameters.

There was a -0.26 direct negative effect of increasing salinity during normal canal flow on the small oyster size class possibly reflecting undocumented increases in marine predators and a negative total effect (negative indirect + direct effects) of the salinity gradient on adult oysters. Very low salinity occurring during extreme (disturbance) canal flows produced large negative direct and total effects on small oysters, but no significant total effect for adult oysters. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) during normal canal flow had negative total effects on small oysters but positive total effects on adult oysters. The effect of max Chl-a on adult oysters was strongly negative during disturbance-level canal flow. Turbidity during normal canal flow had no effect on small or adult oysters.

The capacity of coastal ecosystems, like marshes and oyster reefs, to maintain their own habitat and grow with sea-level rise via biophysical feedbacks is seen as an important advantage of such systems compared to man-made hard engineering structures. Providing a suitable substrate for oysters to settle on offers a kick-start for establishment at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Accumulation of shell material, through recruitment and growth, is essential to the maintenance of oyster reefs as it provides substrate for new generations (positive feedback loop), forming a self-sustainable structure. Insight in establishment, survival and growth thresholds and knowledge about the population dynamics are necessary to successfully implement oyster reefs in coastal defence schemes. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether artificial Pacific oyster reefs develop into self-sustaining oyster reefs that contribute to coastal protection. Reef development was investigated by studying recruitment, survival and growth rates of oysters on artificial oyster reefs in comparison with nearby natural Pacific oyster reefs. The artificial reef structure successfully offered substrate for settlement of oysters and therefore stimulated reef formation. Reef development, however, was hampered by local sedimentation and increasing tidal emersion. Tidal emersion is an important factor that can be used to predict where artificial oyster reefs have the potential to develop into self-sustaining reefs that could contribute to coastal protection, but it is also a limiting factor in using oyster reefs for coastal protection.

While considerable effort and resources have been implemented into restoring these important environmental engineers, the success of oyster populations is often limited by poor understanding of site-specific dispersal patterns of propagules. Water-borne transport is a key factor controlling or regulating the dispersal of the larval stage of benthic marine invertebrates which have limited mobility. The distribution of the native oyster Ostrea edulis in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, together with their densities and population structure at subtidal and intertidal sites has been documented at irregular intervals between 1997 and 2013. This paper revisits this historical data and considers whether different prevailing environmental conditions can be used to explain the distribution, densities and population structure of O. edulis in Strangford Lough. The approach adopted involved comparing predictive 2D hydrodynamic models coupled with particle tracking to simulate the dispersal of oyster larvae with historical and recent field records of the distribution of both subtidal and intertidal, populations since 1995. Results from the models support the hypothesis that commercial stocks of 0. edulis introduced into Strangford Lough in the 1990s resulted in the re-establishment of wild populations of oysters in the Northern Basin which in turn provided a potential source of propagules for subtidal populations. These results highlight that strategic site selection (while inadvertent in the case of the introduced population in 1995) for the re-introduction of important shellfish species can significantly accelerate their recovery and restoration.

In fall and winter, we used quantitative PCR to measure abundance of 16S rRNA and nitrite reductase genes for denitrification (nirS and nirK) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (nrfA) in sediment. We measured water column nutrients and chlorophyll a, sediment C:N and organic matter (OM), exchangeable ammonium (NH4 (+)), ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification potential (DNP). Oysters did not affect gene abundance in fall, when we predicted that their influence would be strongest, or in winter. However, gene abundance was significantly different among sites and seasons. Factors which explained 16S rRNA, nirS, and nirK gene abundance included sediment OM, water column N, and chlorophyll a, similar to previous research. Abundance of nrfA was lower than that of nir genes and positively related to sediment C:N, suggesting OM lability may drive the balance between nir and nrfA. Finally, nirS and nirK abundance was unrelated to DNP, which is consistent with variable results from the literature.

The degree to which these management activities perform similar functions for removing N, however, has not been extensively examined in New England, a place where nutrient runoff is high and increasing oyster (Crassostrea virginica) restoration and aquaculture activity is taking place. Here, we use a novel in situ methodology to directly measure net N-2 and O-2 fluxes across the sediment-water interface in a shallow (similar to 1 m) coastal pond in southern Rhode Island. We collected data seasonally during 2013 and 2014 at restored oyster reefs, oyster aquaculture, oyster cultch (shell), and bare sediment.

Denitrification rates at sites with oyster cultch were 60.9 (+/- 44.3) mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1), which is substantially less than the sites with active oysters but still more than 50% higher than denitrification rates measured in bare sediment (24.4 +/- 10.1 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)). The increase in denitrification rates at treatments, however, varied by season and the greatest rates for restored reefs were in the fall. Overall, the greatest aggregate denitrification rates occurred in the fall. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) followed similar patterns but with greater overall rates in the summer, and displayed a strong linear relationship with denitrification (R-2 = 0.93). Our results demonstrate that habitats associated with live oysters have higher net denitrification rates and that oyster reef restoration and oyster aquaculture may provide similar benefits to the ecosystem in terms of N removal. However, gas fluxes may also be affected where three-dimensional structure is introduced via oyster shell cultch and this appears to be seasonally-dependent.

Consequently, we developed, calibrated, and validated an HSI for the eastern oyster to identify optimal habitat for restoration in a tributary of Chesapeake Bay, the Great Wicomico River (GWR).

Live adult oyster density was a statistically-significant sigmoid function of the HSI, which validates the HSI as a robust predictor of suitable oyster reef habitat for rehabilitation or restoration. In addition, HRR had on average 103-116 more adults m(-2) than LRR at a given level of the HSI. For HRR, HSI >= 0.3 exceeded the accepted restoration target of 50 live adult oysters m(-2).

The programs featured identification of factors that limited oyster abundances on the beds, and then taking immediate steps to reduce their effects. They also featured using information and ideas from the oyster managers in Connecticut, and oystermen and public fisheries officials on PEI. The programs included observing the beds and oysters using scuba. The Connecticut beds received too few shells to collect seed oysters, and mortalities of seed were high. The oyster beds on PEI had been scarcely cultivated. The restoration program in Connecticut lasted for 5 y, 1966 to 1970, and on PEI was for 1 y, 1972 to 1973, but it continued afterward. The Connecticut oysters increased in abundance when oystermen effectively spread more shells to collect seed and reduced mortalities of the seed by controlling starfish Asterias forbesi (Desor, 1848), oyster drills Usosalpinx cinerea (Say, 1822), and Eupleura caudata (Say, 1822), and ""winter-kill.''

Funding limitations can prevent adequate monitoring, but we suggest that the lack of accepted metrics to address the diversity of restoration objectives also presents a serious challenge to the monitoring of restoration projects. A working group with experience in designing and monitoring oyster reef projects was used to develop standardized monitoring metrics, units, and performance criteria that would allow for comparison among restoration sites and projects of various construction types. A set of four universal metrics (reef areal dimensions, reef height, oyster density, and oyster size-frequency distribution) and a set of three universal environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) are recommended to be monitored for all oyster habitat restoration projects regardless of their goal(s). In addition, restoration goal-based metrics specific to four commonly cited ecosystem service-based restoration goals are recommended, along with an optional set of seven supplemental ancillary metrics that could provide information useful to the interpretation of prerestoration and postrestoration monitoring data. Widespread adoption of a common set of metrics with standardized techniques and units to assess well-defined goals not only allows practitioners to gauge the performance of their own projects but also allows for comparison among projects, which is both essential to the advancement of the field of oyster restoration and can provide new knowledge about the structure and ecological function of oyster reef ecosystems.",2015-11,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,737-745,,6,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000363671300003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JBRCTBWQ,journalArticle,2015,"Keppel, Andrew G.; Breitburg, Denise L.; Wikfors, Gary H.; Burrell, Rebecca B.; Clark, Virginia M.",Effects of co-varying diel-cycling hypoxia and pH on disease susceptibility in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,0171-8630,10.3354/meps11479,,"Diel-cycling hypoxia co-occurs with diel-cycling pH in shallow waters that are typically considered as refuge from deep-water hypoxia and are, therefore, targeted for restoration.

Severe diel-cycling DO increased the acquisition and progression of Perkinsus infections during exposure, and had a legacy effect the next year. Diel-cycling pH did not significantly affect infection dynamics either on its own or in combination with diel-cycling DO. Diel-cycling DO and pH both individually and in conjunction stimulated hemocyte activity, although this stimulated activity may not be effective at preventing Perkinsus infection.

Such fringing reef approaches, however, often lack empirical data to identify locations where reefs are most effective in reducing marsh erosion, or fully take into account habitat suitability. Using monitoring data from 5 separate fringing reef projects across coastal Louisiana, we quantify shoreline exposure (fetch + wind direction + wind speed) and reef impacts on shoreline retreat. Our results indicate that fringing oyster reefs have a higher impact on shoreline retreat at higher exposure shorelines. At higher exposures, fringing reefs reduced marsh edge erosion an average of 1.0 m y(-1). Using these data, we identify ranges of shoreline exposure values where oyster reefs are most effective at reducing marsh edge erosion and apply this knowledge to a case study within one Louisiana estuary.

In addition to supporting valuable aquaculture and wild-harvest industries, their populations determine the structure of benthic communities, cycling of nutrients, serve as prey resources for higher trophic levels and, in some instances, stabilize shorelines and maintain water quality. This paper reviews existing knowledge of the ecology of host-parasite interactions involving marine molluscs, with a focus on gastropods and bivalves. It considers the ecological and evolutionary impacts of molluscan parasites on their hosts and vice versa, and on the communities and ecosystems in which they are a part, as well as disease management and its ecological impacts. An increasing number of case studies show that disease can have important effects on marine molluscs, their ecological interactions and ecosystem services, at spatial scales from centimeters to thousands of kilometers and timescales ranging from hours to years. In some instances the cascading indirect effects arising from parasitic infection of molluscs extend well beyond the temporal and spatial scales at which molluscs are affected by disease. In addition to the direct effects of molluscan disease, there can be large indirect impacts on marine environments resulting from strategies, such as introduction of non-native species and selective breeding for disease resistance, put in place to manage disease. Much of our understanding of impacts of molluscan diseases on the marine environment has been derived from just a handful of intensively studied marine parasite-host systems, namely gastropod-trematode, cockle-trematode, and oyster-protistan interactions. Understanding molluscan host-parasite dynamics is of growing importance because: (I) expanding aquaculture; (2) current and future climate change; (3) movement of non-native species; and (4) coastal development are modifying molluscan disease dynamics, ultimately leading to complex relationships between diseases and cultivated and natural molluscan populations. Further, in some instances the enhancement or restoration of valued ecosystem services may be contingent on management of molluscan disease. The application of newly emerging molecular tools and remote sensing techniques to the study of molluscan disease will be important in identifying how changes at varying spatial and temporal scales with global change are modifying host-parasite systems.

For the management of marine shellfish resources, marine diseases pose additional challenges in early intervention after the appearance of disease, management of the diseased population to limit a decline in host abundance, and application of measures to restrain that decline once it occurs. Mathematical models provide one approach for quantifying these effects and addressing the competing goals of managing the diseased population versus managing the disease. The majority of models for molluscan diseases fall into three categories distinguished by these competing goals. (1) Models that consider disease effects on the host population tend to focus on pathogen proliferation within the host. Many of the well-known molluscan diseases are pandemic, in that they routinely reach high prevalence rapidly over large geographic expanses, are characterized by transmission that does not depend upon a local source, and exert a significant influence on host population dynamics. Models focused on disease proliferation examine the influence of environmental change on host population metrics and provide a basis to better manage diseased stocks. Such models are readily adapted to questions of fishery management and habitat restoration. (2) Transmission models are designed to understand the mechanisms triggering epizootics, identify factors impeding epizootic development, and evaluate controls on the rate of disease spread over the host's range. Transmission models have been used extensively to study terrestrial diseases, yet little attention has been given to their potential for understanding the epidemiology of marine molluscan diseases. For management of diseases of wild stocks, transmission models open up a range of options, including the application of area management, manipulation of host abundance, and use of scavengers and filter feeders to limit the concentration of infective particles. (3) The details of host population processes and pathogen transmission dynamics are blended in models that evaluate the effects of natural selection and/or genetic modification in developing disease resistance in the host population. Application of gene-based models to marine diseases is only now beginning and represents a promising approach that may provide a mechanistic basis for managing marine diseases and their host populations. Overall disease models remain both uncommon and underutilized in addressing the needs for managing molluscan diseases and their host populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Development and coastal population growth are the leading causes for habitat losses. Recently, the restoration of marine habitats has increased, especially with the goal of increasing non-consumptive ecosystem services derived from mangrove and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) along with biogenic oyster reefs. Habitats reside in landscapes dominated by multiple species. Rather than focusing on a single habitat such as oysters or mangroves or SAV, we took an approach restoring multiple adjacent habitats to accelerate restoration in a Florida embayment that had been significantly degraded prior to the restoration of natural tidally generated flows. After a multiple habitat die-off, a project was initiated in 2006 to reintroduce tidal flushing. The re-introduction of tidal flushing, however, did not result in immediate recovery of mangrove shorelines or oyster-dominated reefs. There was a lack of mangrove propagule production and significant substrate limitation in areas with appropriate salinity, sediment and tidal flows. From 2009-2012, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) propagules were collected (over 500,000) and planted for a total area of 3.24 ha. From 2009-2010, five intertidal reefs were constructed by adding bagged and fossil shell (54 MT) for Crassostrea virginica larvae to recruit onto totaling over 779 m(2). Monitoring of planted mangrove versus unplanted shorelines demonstrated that prop root and drop root densities were higher where propagules were planted (28 m(-2)) versus unplanted (2.3 m(-2)). Oyster densities and mean sizes (multiple year classes) at new and natural reefs were measured after 8, 12, and 24, and 36 months. An initial settlement pulse was observed in the first 8 months followed by an increase in the density of greater than 1-year old oysters. Xanthid crab densities (Eurypanopeus depressus and Panopeus spp.) in restored reefs and natural reefs were similar, while Petrolisthes armatus densities were lower in restored reefs. Whole reef seston filtration rates over restored reefs were -26 to 157 L m(-2) h(-1) when measured at 4,15, 28, and 40 months. A multiple habitat approach may be useful in accelerating the natural ecological succession, especially if the project site has reached a degraded, alternate ecological state. These results suggest a multiple habitat approach can be useful in providing non-provisioning ecosystem services to a Florida embayment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To determine the geographic dispersal of populations of oyster larvae and how swimming behavior of larvae alters settlement patterns within Virginia (USA) coastal bays, this study utilized a depth-averaged Delft3D(C) hydrodynamic model coupled to a larval behavior model which incorporates an increased downward swimming speed in response to elevated turbulence. Turbulence and flow measurements over oyster reefs, oyster restoration sites, and bare seafloor were quantified using velocimeters. Hydrodynamic cues were input into the larval behavior model to determine how changes in swimming behavior due to turbulence influence settlement patterns. Results indicate that alterations in settlement velocity, specifically maintaining approximate neutral buoyancy until larvae are both mature and over an existing reef, substantially increased the probability of settling on suitable substrate. We also found that oyster reefs in low velocity regions have a higher probability of self-colonization, while reefs found in less sheltered higher velocity environments receive comparatively little of their own larvae and depend upon connectivity with other areas. Data from in situ larval settlement plates agree with model results and indicate that rates of settlement are similar to 1.5 to 3x greater over existing reefs composed of primarily vertically oriented oysters than over restoration reefs that are less topographically complex.",9/15/15,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,161-176,,,535,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000361694000011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JCDYAWQ2,journalArticle,2015,"Humphries, Austin T.; La Peyre, Megan K.",Oyster reef restoration supports increased nekton biomass and potential commercial fishery value,Peerj,,2167-8359,10.7717/peerj.1111,,"Across the globe, discussions centered on the value of nature drive many conservation and restoration decisions.

Here, we quantified species biomass and potential commercial value of nekton collected from restored oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in coastal Louisiana over a 3-year period, providing multiple snapshots of biomass support over time.

Furthermore, low recruitment of wild larvae has also impeded restoration, indicating a need to assess the potential of field setting of cultured larvae. We experimentally examined oyster settlement, growth and survival on unconsolidated OS, vertically embedded oyster shell (ES) in concrete, and concrete Oyster Castles (OC) in field and mesocosm experiments. In addition, we examined settlement success of cultured larvae in the mesocosm experiment. In the field experiment, juvenile recruitment was 3 higher on castles and unconsolidated shell than on embedded shell. Castles retained 4Xthe number of oysters and hosted 5Xthe biomass than embedded shell, and retained 1.5Xthe oysters and hosted 3Xthe biomass than unconsolidated shell.

Nitrogen sequestration potential was determined from growth in aquaculture cages, extrapolated to 50% cage coverage over a range of areas in each bay. In the extreme case of total suitable habitat coverage, oysters in Jamaica Bay could extract a total of similar to 61% of nitrogen input, and 47% if 5,000 acres were covered; whereas impressive, the oysters could not be sold for food and the cost of such a plan would be prohibitive. In Great South Bay, aquaculture covering 5,000 acres would take up 148% of the nitrogen input, which is encouraging because aquaculture leases are beginning to be awarded in this bay and most waters are clean enough for harvest and human consumption.

Given the breadth of environmental benefits oysters provide, as well as their commercial and cultural importance, sustainable oyster production has become a priority in several regions, including the Chesapeake Bay. Current strategies include treating restored reefs as permanent sanctuaries, which provide long-term environmental benefits yet removes them from the fishery, or harvesting reefs on a rotational basis, which provides economic value yet decreases environmental benefits. The long term dynamics of these strategies is unknown. Oysters have a complex, biphasic life cycle (i.e., sessile adult and motile larval stages) and their viability is intimately tied to a suite of environmental factors including, but not limited to, flow regime, total suspended solids, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. In order to determine how different oyster management strategies affect oyster dynamics, we developed a multi-model approach that integrates a 2-D hydrodynamic model, a larval transport model, and a spatially-explicit, agent-based population dynamics model to simulate long term oyster dynamics. We applied our model to a ten reef system in the Great Wicomico River in the Chesapeake Bay, and simulated six different combinations of sanctuary and/or harvest management scenarios over an 8-year period. We evaluated the environmental and commercial benefits of each strategy. Our results indicated that sanctuary reefs are beneficial, and that the spatial position of sanctuary reefs strongly affected source-sink dynamics and must be considered before implementing a harvest regime. Simulations that did not consider the source/sink dynamics of the reefs yielded larger numbers of oysters for harvest in the short-term, yet resulted in a complete fishery collapse in the long term. Selective, rotational harvest, resulted in lower annual yield, but the fishery persisted throughout the eight year simulation. This integrated modeling approach helped reduce uncertainty within the study system and can help natural resource managers understand ecosystem-level processes leading to more informed decision making across spatial and temporal scales.

Coastal Louisiana contains extensive oyster reef areas that have been harvested for decades, and whether differences in habitat functions exist between those areas and nonharvested reefs is unclear. We compared reef physical structure and resident community metrics between these 2 sub-tidal reef types. Harvested reefs were more fragmented and had lower densities of live eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and hooked mussels (Ischadium recurvum) than the nonharvested reefs. Stable isotope values (C-13 and N-15) of dominant nekton species and basal food sources were used to compare food web characteristics. Nonpelagic source contributions and trophic positions of dominant species were slightly elevated at harvested sites. Oyster harvesting appeared to have decreased the number of large oysters and to have increased the percentage of reefs that were nonliving by decreasing water column filtration and benthopelagic coupling. The differences in reef matrix composition, however, had little effect on resident nekton communities.

To build a scientific basis for oyster restoration, an elevated experimental reef stocked with O. edulis was established within Poole Bay (Dorset, UK). Oysters were out planted on twenty four oyster reef modules (80 cm above sea bed) and compared with oysters held on the sea bed close to each reef module to test the hypothesis that a reef habitat enhanced physiological performance. Filtration and respiration rates, condition index, haemolymph protein concentration, haemocyte counts and gonad maturation were measured as indicators of physiological performance. During the first 15 months of oyster reef deployment, water samples were collected at regular intervals at the sea bed and at a height of 80 cm from the sea bed to determine chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and bacterial abundance. Total suspended solids were significantly higher at the sea bed than at 80 cm above the sea bed at every sampling interval, while bacterial abundance adjacent to the sea bed was significantly higher than 80 cm above the sea bed in August and November 2013 when temperature was 18 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of 'reef oysters' (oysters on elevated reefs) were significantly higher than 'sea bed oysters' (oysters held on the sea bed). Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. As current stocks of European flat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe.

There is growing evidence that the biological and physical sounds associated with adult habitats (i.e., the ""soundscape"") influence larval settlement and habitat selection; however, the significance of acoustic cues is rarely tested.

To understand how N removal may change with ontogeny, we compared N in tissue, shell, and biodeposits between juvenile and adult oysters. Juvenile oysters assimilated 165 +/- 8 mg (+/- SE) N oyster(-1) into soft tissues and shell, while adult oysters lost mass and returned N to the estuary (-48 +/- 21 mg N oyster(-1)). The percentage of N in soft tissues (11.80 +/- 0.01) did not differ between age classes but was significantly higher than measured elsewhere.

N released in biodeposits was estimated at 0.21 +/- 0.00 to 0.23 +/- 0.00 mg N oyster(-1) d(-1) and did not differ between age classes. Accurate quantification of N removal by oysters, therefore, should account for age and location-specific variation by including direct measurements of N assimilated into tissues and shell, released in biodeposits, and removed by biogeochemical processes.

Survival only declined significantly when 90% or more of an oyster was buried; the critical burial depth inducing 50% mortality was 108%. This finding will allow scaling of mortality rates of oysters as a function of sediment load and oyster size. Biodeposition and condition index were negatively related to burial depth, whereas shell growth increased with burial depth. Decreases in biodeposition and condition index were likely related to disruption of feeding by burial and reallocation of energy resources to shell growth. The increase in shell growth was analogous to vertical migration of infaunal species-buried oysters increased vertical shell growth to breach the sediment surface to feed and respire, at the expense of tissue growth. While oysters are tolerant of partial burial in terms of survival, burial adversely affects metabolic processes that influence demographic rates and reef persistence.

P. marinus infections cause the disease known as Dermo, have been responsible for declines in oyster populations, and have limited success of oyster restoration efforts. The severity of diel-cycling hypoxia varied among shallow monitored sites in Chesapeake Bay, and average daily minimum dissolved oxygen was positively correlated with average daily minimum pH. In both field and laboratory experiments, diel-cycling hypoxia increased acquisition and progression of infections, with stronger results found for younger (1-year-old) than older (2-3-year-old) oysters, and more pronounced effects on both infections and growth found in the field than in the laboratory. Filtration by oysters was reduced during brief periods of exposure to severe hypoxia. This should have reduced exposure to waterborne P. marinus, and contributed to the negative relationship found between hypoxia frequency and oyster growth. Negative effects of hypoxia on the host immune response is, therefore, the likely mechanism leading to elevated infections in oysters exposed to hypoxia relative to control treatments.

Landscape scale agricultural and urban modifications require flood control which sometimes results in the release of excess freshwater that potentially damages estuarine ecology. The Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) is a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District focused on restoring natural patterns of freshwater flow to the Everglades and associated estuaries. One of the primary project goals is to reduce deleterious inflows eastward to the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) and westward to the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) by diverting freshwater south from Lake Okeechobee. Performance evaluation of the CEPP relies upon integrated modeling which links the watershed engineering projects to estuarine salinities and biotic responses. The objective of this study was to utilize seagrass and oyster models to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative inflow scenarios. There are three different scenarios: the existing condition base (ECB), the future without proposed CEPP projects (FWO) but with other landscape features that could alter freshwater inflows, and alternative 4R (ALT4R) that incorporates a suite of restoration projects including those associated with the CEPP. Each of these inflow scenarios was used to generate daily salinity time series from 1965 to 2005 at multiple locations in the SLE and CRE which were used to run site-specific seagrass and oyster models. The hydrodynamic and ecological effects of freshwater inflow were greater in the SLE compared to the much larger CRE. Predicted densities of oysters (individuals m(-2)) and seagrass (shoots m(-2)) were greater in the wet season (May-Oct) vs. the dry season (Nov-Apr) in both estuaries. Oyster and seagrass densities increased under the ALT4R inflow scenario that mitigated high inflows to the estuaries in the wet season. This result improved environmental conditions while increasing freshwater availability for other parts of the Greater Everglades and the southern estuaries such as Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay.

We examine how each of the models define the maximum filtration rate and explore the various limitation factors that modify these maximum rates via environmental conditions that include salinity, temperature, and total suspended solids. Based on the individual model strengths assessed with a model comparison and literature review, we determine a maximum filtration rate of 0.17 (+/- 0.07)m(3) g(-1) DW day(-1) for a 1 g DW oyster to describe this rate process, which is then modified by a combination of limitation factors taken from a variety of sources. These include those described by Fulford et al. (2007) for total suspended solids and salinity, and a newly developed function to describe temperature dependence.

The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series of environmental stressors to this region, which have included hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental, e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors. The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery, water, and petroleum resources.

Concurrent with the decline in oyster density was an increase in the prevalence of boring sponges (Cliona) on oysters and the underlying reef substrate material at these sites. The limestone marl substrate used to build these reefs became colonized by boring sponge to the degree that bioerosion by sponge potentially compromised the suitability of the reefs for oysters. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine whether oyster demographic rates of settlement, recruitment, growth, and mortality were affected by the presence of Cliona on underlying shell substrate. Oyster settlement on shells with varying levels of sponge was measured in the laboratory, and oyster recruitment, growth, and mortality in the presence and absence of sponge were measured in 2 estuaries in coastal North Carolina from 2011 to 2012. Potential alternative substrates for future reef restoration were tested in the field to determine their susceptibility to bioerosion by sponges. Substrates included 2 composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3; oyster shells and limestone marl) and 2 non-CaCO3 substrates (concrete and granite), because bioerosion by clionids target CaCO3. Surprisingly, no differences in oyster settlement, recruitment, growth, or mortality in the presence versus absence of Cliona were observed, suggesting that effects of the presence of sponge on oysters are either chronic rather than acute or are indirect and must act in concert with other oyster enemies. Notable patterns of sponge growth on the alternate substrates emerged; oyster shells were most susceptible to sponge growth, followed by marl, whereas concrete and granite were not susceptible to colonization by Cliona. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of having a strong understanding of the specific restoration methodology to be implemented, because the susceptibility of a substrate to bioerosion could have serious implications for reef longevity. Evidence is presented that consideration of the broader estuarine environment, including both biotic and abiotic factors, is vital when planning restoration actions, because the presence of Cliona was less important than the estuarine salinity gradient in altering oyster demographic rates and may shift the trajectories of restored reefs.",2014-11,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,727-738,,3,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000346131900007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6D8EB86T,journalArticle,2014,"Cordero, Ma L.

Gradients in competition and predation that regulate communities should guide biogenic habitat restoration, while restoration ecology provides opportunities to address fundamental questions regarding food web dynamics via large-scale field manipulations. 2. We restored oyster reefs across an aerial exposure gradient (shallow-subtidal-to-mid-intertidal) to explore how vertical gradients in natural settlement, growth and interspecific interactions affected the trajectory of man-made shellfish reefs. 3. We recorded nearly an order-of-magnitude higher oyster settlement on the deepest (subtidal) reefs, but within a year abundance patterns reversed, and oyster densities were ultimately highest on the shallowest (intertidal) reefs by over an order-of-magnitude. 4. This reversal was due to (i) significantly elevated survivorship on intertidal reefs and (ii) larger surviving oysters on intertidal reefs. These patterns are likely to have developed from greater levels of biofouling and predator abundance (e.g. stone crabs, gastropods) on deeper reefs where aerial exposure was <5% of the monthly tidal cycle. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of restoration initiatives involving habitat-forming species can be enhanced by accounting for the biotic interactions that regulate population fitness. In littoral systems, vertical gradients in predation, competition and disturbance can be exploited to guide restoration of vegetated (e.g. mangrove, seagrass) or biogenic reef habitats. In particular, our results demonstrate that paradigms of vertical zonation learned from the rocky intertidal and saltmarshes also describe the fate of restored shellfish reefs. As with rocky shores, the lower vertical limit of adult oyster distribution in our study system was most likely driven by predatory and competitive (i.e. smothering) interactions, with a threshold depth at c. 5% daily aerial exposure. Below this depth, experimentally restored reefs failed completely.

A significant management challenge is appropriate site selection. We are proposing the inclusion of a biological parameter (evaluation of tissue histopathology) in an inexpensive and rapid site selection model to inform management decision making and identify sites with the greatest potential for reintroduction success. Use of biological biomarkers is not a new concept, but it is important that they be included in a multitiered management approach to bivalve reintroduction. This Case Study tested adult Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) from locations that supported comparable short-term survival rates by evaluating growth and tissue health and/or disease. Biomarkers indicated oyster tissues at one site were normal, the female:male sex ratio was 50:50, and female oysters were in spawning condition. Conversely, oyster tissues at the second site exhibited multiple abnormalities, samples were 100% male, and the incidence of disease was high. Using the biomarker tool, we evaluated 4 additional sites where oysters exhibited short-term (1 year) survival. At 2 locations, we observed chronic health impacts that would preclude reintroduction, including samples from one site where a wild population was surviving. We also analyzed tissue and shell heavy metal contents. Soft tissue metal concentrations in Meadowlands samples were at the high range of scientific literature values, averaging 1.1% of total body weight, whereas tissue metal concentrations at the Keyport site were within acceptable ranges. Although initial survival and growth rates at both locations were comparable, site-specific urban stressors reduced oyster fitness at 1 of the 2 locations.

The population dynamics often display extreme natural interannual variation in numbers and biomass, and oysters create their own habitat-the reef itself. With the worldwide decline of oyster reef habitat and the oyster fisheries dependent thereon, the maintenance of shell has received renewed attention as essential to population sustainability. We apply a shell budget model to estimate the sustainable catch of oysters on public oyster grounds in Louisiana using no net shell loss as a sustainability reference point. Oyster density and size are obtained from an annual stock assessment. The model simulates oyster growth and mortality, and natural shell loss. Shell mass is increased when oysters die in place, and is diminished when oysters are removed by fishing.

Oyster abundance has declined precipitously during the past century along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as a result of overfishing, disease and predation, and large-scale human-mediated events. Given the importance of oysters, both ecologically and economically, there have been significant efforts during the past 20 y to reestablish and/or restore oysters to historical levels. Successful reef restoration depends on choosing sites that optimize survival, which requires an understanding of the environmental factors that influence the life stage of an oyster. For most restoration projects, time and budget constraints prevent long-term field studies; therefore, modeling is often used to determine the best locations for restoration. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit, flexible, 4-parameter habitat suitability index model that can be used to determine locations suitable for restoration of eastern oyster reefs throughout the western Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The model captures the minimum environmental parameters required for successful restoration suitability and was applied in 2 studies: (1) Chesapeake Bay, a data rich environment, and (2) northern Gulf of Mexico (western Mississippi Sound), a data poor environment. It illustrates the implications of using data of varying quality when applying the model for identifying restoration potential.

We measured the temperature-dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2-fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5-3 mu m), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer.

The purpose of this study was to assess how predators and abiotic conditions affect oyster mortality and growth at different tidal elevations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that abiotic conditions, primarily hypoxia and salinity, as well as oyster disease, limits oysters to intertidal areas. Yet, in Corpus Christi Bay, oysters are absent from subtidal areas where hypoxia is not known to occur. Infection by Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) is common in the study area, but previous work suggests that infection rates do not increase when oysters are transplanted subtidally. We investigated oyster tidal distributions by transplanting newly settled oysters into intertidal and subtidal areas. Predation on oysters was significantly greater in subtidal as compared to intertidal habitats. When protected from predators using cages, oyster survival significantly increased. Further, oysters in subtidal areas allocated significantly more resources to shell growth than did those in intertidal areas, and oysters are known to grow heavier shells in response to predators. Oyster settlement was not statistically different between inter and subtidal areas, and abiotic conditions measured during the study did not exceed known tolerance limits for oysters.

The composition and porosity of marl may make it vulnerable to infestation by carbonate bioeroders, particularly clionid sponges. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of carbonate (CaCO3; oyster shell, marl) versus noncarbonate (non-CaCO3; granite, concrete) reef-building substrates on C. virginica demographic rates, including oyster density and oyster growth, on experimental reefs constructed along the salinity gradients of two estuaries in coastal North Carolina. There were no differences in oyster density among substrate types through the first 6 mo of reef sampling, although at 12 mo after reef construction, differences in density among substrates had emerged. Sites in high-salinity areas had much greater oyster recruitment than up-estuary, lower salinity locations. Early-life growth (<6 mo) of oysters was assessed for recruits to experimental reefs, with few differences seen in oyster mean valve length or growth rate on different substrate types.

Interest in their restoration has motivated research into oyster-mediated ecosystem services including effects on biodiversity, filtration, and nitrogen (N) cycling. Recent evidence suggests oysters may promote denitrification, or anaerobic respiration of nitrate (NO3-) into di-nitrogen gas, via benthic deposition of carbon (C) and N-rich biodeposits. However, the mechanisms whereby biodeposits promote N transformations prerequisite to denitrification (e.g., mineralization and nitrification) are unclear. Previous research has also not measured oysters' influence on N cycling in urbanized areas. In May 2010 we deployed eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in mesh cages above sand-filled boxes at four sites across a nutrient gradient in Jamaica Bay, New York City (New York, USA). Oysters were arranged at four densities: 0, 40, 85, and 150 oysters/m(2). For 17 months we measured water-column nutrients and chlorophyll a, every two weeks to monthly. Every two months we measured sediment ash-free dry mass (AFDM), exchangeable ammonium (NH4+), ammonification, nitrification, denitrification potential (DNP), and NO3- and C limitation of DNP. Oysters increased sediment AFDM at three of four sites, with the greatest increase at high density. Oysters did not affect any N pools or transformations. However, variation among sites and dates illustrated environmental drivers of C and N biogeochemistry in this urban estuary. Overall, nitrification was positively related to net ammonification, water column NH4+, and sediment NH4+, but was not correlated with DNP. Denitrification was consistently and strongly NO3- limited, while C was not limiting or secondarily limiting. Therefore, the oyster-mediated increase in AFDM did not affect DNP because C was not its primary driver. Also, because DNP was unrelated to nitrification, it is unlikely that biodeposit N was converted to NO3- for use as a denitrification substrate. Predicting times or sites where denitrification is driven by the C and N species originating from oyster biodeposits remains a challenge under eutrophic conditions. Towards this goal, we synthesized our conclusions with literature predictions in a conceptual model for pathways whereby oysters might influence C and N dynamics differently in oligotrophic relative to eutrophic ecosystems.",2014-03,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,271-286,,2,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000331405700004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,XD8W4XHB,journalArticle,2014,"Park, Kyeong; Powers, Sean P.; Bosarge, George S.; Jung, Hoon-Shin","Plugging the leak: Barrier island restoration following Hurricane Katrina enhances larval retention and improves salinity regime for oysters in Mobile Bay, Alabama",Marine Environmental Research,,0141-1136,10.1016/j.marenvres.2013.12.003,,"Changes in geomorphology of estuaries are common following major perpetuations such as hurricanes and may have profound impacts on biological systems. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 created a new pass, called Katrina Cut, halving Dauphin Island in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Significant decline in oyster population at Cedar Point Reef, the primary oyster harvest grounds in Mobile Bay, had persisted since then until the Cut was artificially closed in 2010. A bio-physical model for hydrodynamics and oyster larval transport was used to evaluate two potential mechanisms responsible for oyster population declines: salinity changes in the context of oyster habitat suitability and retention of oyster larvae. The model results revealed that when open Katrina Cut increased salinity at Cedar Point Reef. During high freshwater discharge, in particular, water exchange through Katrina Cut increased the bottom salinity from <5 psu to well over 15 (sometimes >20) psu during the tropic tides. Elevated salinities are associated with greater predation on oysters and higher disease incidence. The presence of the Katrina Cut also reduced larval retention in the spawning area regardless of tidal or river discharge conditions. We conclude that closing the Cut likely improved conditions for oysters within Mobile Bay and eastern Mississippi Sound and that these improved conditions have contributed to increased oyster landings.

We established an ecological baseline using a combination of live, dead, archaeological, and fossil material to investigate the impacts of these stressors on the molluscan community. We expected that ecological change would increase with eutrophication-hypoxia west towards New York City. Instead we found that taxonomic similarity, rank-order abundance, and drilling frequency are more strongly controlled by commercial fishing pressure than by decreasing dissolved oxygen. Commercial fisherman collecting quahog clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), physically disrupt surface-dwelling organisms and also kill large numbers of predatory gastropods, including the channeled whelk, Busycotypus canaliculatus, and the drilling moonsnails Neverita duplicata and Euspira heros, to protect hard clam stocks. As a result, areas dredged by commercial fishermen yield fewer shells with drill-holes and fewer surface-dwelling organisms than unfished sites. In spite of recent reductions in lobster fishing, crushing predation by crabs and lobsters on clams has been suppressed below baseline levels throughout US, even in the well oxygenated east. The absence of a clear relationship between eutrophication-hypoxia and ecological change questions the effectiveness of nitrogen reduction alone as a restoration strategy. LIS fossils revealed a relatively ancient loss of those mollusks associated with seagrass and oyster habitats (e.g., oysters, Crassostrea virginica; jingle shells, Anomia simplex; scallops, Argopecten irradiens; and the gastropod Bittiolum alternatum) that predates the accumulation of dead shells and underscores the need for older material to reveal the shifting baseline. The interactive nature of multiple stressors means that past overfishing may have dampened the response of communities in LIS to eutrophication or inhibited their capactiy to recover. The unexpected role of hypoxic areas protected from commercial fishing as refuges highlights the utility of no-take marine preserves in eutrophied estuaries worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Management activities, including efforts to enhance larval settlement, to rebuild the Chesapeake Bay eastern oyster population have met with limited success. Since 1939, juvenile oyster abundance has been measured at oyster bars in the northern portion of Chesapeake Bay. Prior analyses of those data indicate that juvenile oyster abundance is influenced by environmental conditions, which are related to regional climate. We quantified a regional scale (1,000km(2)) climate signal using a synoptic climatology approach by identifying predominant weather patterns. We related these weather patterns to Susquehanna River freshwater discharge, a major influencing factor on Chesapeake Bay salinity, and the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), an indicator of the overall wetness or dryness of a given region. We developed path analysis models that linked weather patterns to Susquehanna River discharge and thence to either the PHDI or ambient salinity and water temperature and finally to juvenile oyster abundance in one of four preidentified spatial groupings. The path models indicated that weather patterns that produce wet conditions, leading to a higher PHDI and lower salinity, resulted in reduced juvenile oyster abundance; weather patterns that produce dry conditions that decreased the PHDI and increased salinity resulted in higher juvenile oyster abundance. Our results indicate that regions of higher juvenile oyster abundance may be predicted several months in advance using the path model. These predictions can be used to increase the effectiveness of oyster restoration efforts by indicating where hard substrate added to oyster bars in the four regions is likely to result in greater than average numbers of juvenile oysters.

In estuaries, a decline of overall habitat quality and functioning has led to significant efforts to restore critical ecosystem services, recently through the creation and restoration of oyster reefs. Oyster reef restoration generally occurs with goals of (1) increasing water quality via filtration through sustainable oyster recruitment, (2) stabilizing shorelines, and (3) creating and enhancing critical estuarine habitat for fish and invertebrates. We restored over 260 m(2) of oyster reef habitat in coastal Louisiana and followed the development and provision of these ecosystem services from 2009 through 2012. Oysters recruited to reefs immediately, with densities of oysters greater than 75 mm exceeding 80 ind m(-2) after 3 years, and provision of filtration rates of 1002 perpendicular to 187 L h(-1) m(-2); shoreline stabilization effects of the created reefs were minimal over the three years of monitoring, with some evidence of positive shoreline stabilization during higher wind/energy events only; increased nekton abundance of resident, but not larger transient fish was immediately measurable at the reefs, however, this failed to increase through time. Our results provide critical insights into the development trajectories of ecosystem services provided by restored oyster reefs, as well as the mechanisms mediating these changes. This is critical both ecologically to understand how and where a reef thrives, and for policy and management to guide decision-making related to oyster reef restoration and the crediting and accounting of ecosystem services.

Historically, societal demand for oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest, which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives. Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for exploited ecosystem engineers.",2014,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,38,,3,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343247200046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,XLPBLX39,journalArticle,2014,"Aquino-Thomas, Jessene; Proffitt, C.

In the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), oysters living on prop roots and in isolated clumps on the ground (ground oysters) near mangroves comprise most of the natural population. Overall mean and median densities on prop roots were 750 and 177.8 live oysters m(-2) but only similar to 20 live oysters m(-2) in ground oysters. We collected data on C. virginica abundance and size, mangrove habitat, and physical and geographical variables ( fetch, sediment firmness, distances from inlet and nearest freshwater discharge source) and obtained water quality data (salinity, chlorophyll a, turbidity) from long-term monitoring databases. Data were analyzed using structural equation models (SEM), and we chose the best models by Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Oyster abundance (R-2=0.74) and size (R-2=0.60) on prop roots were functions of mangrove habitat, salinity, sediment, and distance to freshwater discharges. Fetch and distance to inlet affected sediment and thus had indirect effects on oysters. Inlet distance also affected the 5 yr coefficient of variation of salinity. In a separate SEM, the abundance of ground oysters near mangroves was a strong, positive effect on oysters on prop roots, in part because prop root oysters can break off and seed oyster clumps to the ground. However, ground oysters were directly negatively affected by fetch and distance to inlet, which had no direct effects on oysters living on prop roots. Red mangroves facilitate oysters by providing protection from sedimentation and offering a stable refuge during storms. However, increasing numbers of mangroves near a site had negative effects on oysters on the ground, possibly because it provided an enhanced habitat for predators.",2014,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,177-194,,,503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335581700012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X77CN7V5,journalArticle,2014,"Gobler, Christopher J.; Talmage, Stephanie C.","Physiological response and resilience of early life-stage Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) to past, present and future ocean acidification",Conservation Physiology,,2051-1434,10.1093/conphys/cou004,,"The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791), is the second most valuable bivalve fishery in the USA and is sensitive to high levels of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)). Here we present experiments that comprehensively examined how the ocean's past, present and projected (21st and 22nd centuries) CO2 concentrations impact the growth and physiology of larval stages of C. virginica. Crassostrea virginica larvae grown in present-day pCO(2) concentrations (380 MU atm) displayed higher growth and survival than individuals grown at both lower (250 mu atm) and higher pCO(2) levels (750 and 1500 mu atm). Crassostrea virginica larvae manifested calcification rates, sizes, shell thicknesses, metamorphosis, RNA: DNA ratios and lipid contents that paralleled trends in survival, with maximal values for larvae grown at 380 mu atm pCO(2) and reduced performance in higher and lower pCO(2) levels. While some physiological differences among oysters could be attributed to CO2-induced changes in size or calcification rates, the RNA: DNA ratios at ambient pCO(2) levels were elevated, independent of these factors. Likewise, the lipid contents of individuals exposed to high pCO(2) levels were depressed even when differences in calcification rates were considered. These findings reveal the cascading, interdependent impact that high CO2 can have on oyster physiology. Crassostrea virginica larvae are significantly more resistant to elevated pCO(2) than other North Atlantic bivalves, such as Mercenaria mercenaria and Argopecten irradians, a finding that may be related to the biogeography and/or evolutionary history of these species and may have important implications for future bivalve restoration and aquaculture efforts.",2014,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,cou004,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000209703800025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,L4PTUJJS,journalArticle,2013,"Soniat, Thomas M.; Conzelmann, Craig P.; Byrd, Jason D.; Roszell, Dustin P.; Bridevaux, Joshua L.; Suir, Kevin J.; Colley, Susan B.",PREDICTING THE EFFECTS OF PROPOSED MISSISSIPPI RIVER DIVERSIONS ON OYSTER HABITAT QUALITY; APPLICATION OF AN OYSTER HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX MODEL,Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.032.0302,,"In an attempt to decelerate the rate of coastal erosion and wetland loss, and protect human communities, the state of Louisiana developed its Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast.

Study locations included Tampa Bay, Mosquito Lagoon, Sebastian River, St. Lucie estuary (3 study sites), Loxahatchee River (2 study sites), Lake Worth Lagoon, and Biscayne Bay. Settled oyster density was monitored twice per year at stations within each study site. Oyster recruitment, water temperature, and salinity were monitored on a monthly basis. Salinity varied greatly among the estuaries, and each study site fell into 1 of 2 primary salinity regimes: one relatively stable and with higher salinities (mean range, 24-35), and the other more variable and with lower salinities (mean range, 12-17). All 7 estuaries were impacted, to varying degrees, by the relatively active 2005 tropical storm season as well as local water management practices during the study. Two of the estuaries, St. Lucie and the Sebastian River, were severely impacted by controlled introductions of freshwater, which decreased salinities below the range that oysters can tolerate. As a result, live oysters were virtually absent from the study sites in both estuaries in 2005, when the freshwater introductions were most pronounced. At the opposite extreme, long-term reduction of freshwater flow into Biscayne Bay has exacerbated already increasing salinities and has resulted in the absence of reef-building oysters at that study site. Oysters were present at all other study sites, but densities were lower in 2005 than in subsequent years because of substantial salinity decreases after tropical storms in 2004 and 2005. The greatest and most stable oyster densities were found in Tampa Bay, where mean oyster density reached 400/m(2) by fall 2007. Recruitment was observed at each site on recruitment arrays retrieved from April through December, although the timing, duration, and intensity of the recruitment season varied annually and among study sites. The Tampa Bay, Mosquito Lagoon, Loxahatchee River, and Lake Worth Lagoon sites exhibited a bimodal recruitment pattern with peaks in the spring and fall. At the remaining sites, which were the most strongly affected by water management practices, recruitment patterns were sporadic and inconsistent throughout the study. The lowest recruitment rates occurred in 2005, when the density of settled oysters was also low, presumably because of reduced salinities resulting from a combination of active tropical storm seasons and controlled freshwater introductions.",2013-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,695-708,,3,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000331554700011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7XZ7KNC2,journalArticle,2013,"Larsen, Peter Foster; Wilson, Karen A.; Morse, Dana",Observations on the Expansion of a Relict Population of Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in a Maine Estuary: Implications for Climate Change and Restoration,Northeastern Naturalist,,1092-6194,10.1656/045.020.0414,,"The Gulf of Maine has undergone dramatic physiographic and oceanographic changes over the last several millenia resulting in some unusual biogeographic consequences.

In this contribution, we describe the circumstances whereby tidal restoration made available 2.5 linear km of new habitat area to the relict oyster population of the Marsh River, ME, the northernmost documented native oyster population in the United States. Oysters recruited to the new habitat quickly, demonstrating the restoration potential of isolated, relict populations.

Until now, intervention strategies against the parasite have found limited success, and Dermo still remains one of the main hurdles for the restoration of oyster populations. We adapted a commercial adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) content-based assay to assess the in vitro proliferation of P. marinus in a 96-well plate format, and validated the method by measuring the effects of potential anti-proliferative compounds. The sensitivity (1.5-3.1 x 10(4) cells/well), linearity (R-2 = 0.983), and signal stability (60 min) support the reliability of the assay for assessing cell proliferation. Validation of the assay by culturing P. marinus in the presence of increasing concentrations of triclosan showed a dose-response profile. The IC50 value obtained was higher than that reported earlier, possibly due to the use of different viability assay methods and a different P. marinus strain. The antibiotics G418 and tetracycline and the herbicide fluridone were active against P. marinus proliferation; the IC50 of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and atrazine was relatively high suggesting either off-target effects or inability to reach the targets. The validation of the ATP-based assay, together with significant advantages of the Perkinsus culture methodology (homogeneity, reproducibility, and high cell densities), underscores the value of this assay for developing high-throughput screens for the identification of novel leader compounds against Perkinsus species, and most importantly, for the closely-related apicomplexan parasites.

This may explain why subtidal oyster reefs declined after major flood events in the late nineteenth century, associated with infestations by spionid polychaete mudworms. Today, mortalities of S. glomerata in the region are associated with QX disease caused by Marteilia sydneyi. Increased virulence of M. sydneyi is likely due to a combination of increased abundance of intermediate hosts in habitat utilised by oysters, together with immunosuppression of the oysters. These processes are all driven by declining water quality derived from anthropogenic catchment development.

Anthropogenic nutrient loading and subsequent eutrophication has been identified by some researchers as a primary driver of these losses, but others have described potential positive effects of eutrophication on some estuarine resources. The Peconic Estuary, Long Island, NY, USA, offers a naturally occurring nutrient-loading gradient from eutrophic tidal creeks in its western reaches to mesotrophic bays in the eastern region. Over 2 years, we conducted an experiment across this gradient to examine the effects of eutrophication on the growth of estuarine species, including juvenile bivalves (northern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria), eastern oysters, (Crassostrea virginica), and bay scallops (Argopecten irradians)) and slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata). Water quality and phytoplankton community biomass and composition were concurrently monitored at each site, and the effects of these variables on the growth of estuarine species were analyzed with multiple regression model. Eutrophication seemed to impact shellfish through changes in the quality of food and not the quantity since the growth rates of shellfish were more often correlated with densities of specific cell types or quality of seston rather than bulk measures of phytoplankton and organic seston. Northern quahogs and eastern oysters grew maximally within eutrophic locales, and their growth was positively correlated with high densities of autotrophic nanoflagellates and centric diatoms in these regions (p < 0.001). The growth rates of northern quahogs were also positively correlated with relative water motion, suggesting an important role for tidal currents in delivering seston to suspension feeders. Bay scallops and slipper limpets were negatively impacted by eutrophication, growing at the slowest rate at the most eutrophic sites. Furthermore, bay scallop growth was negatively correlated with densities of dinoflagellates, which were more abundant at the most eutrophic site (p < 0.001). These results suggest that nutrient loading can have significant but complex effects on suspension-feeding molluscs with select species (e.g., oysters and clams) benefiting from eutrophication and other species performing poorly (e.g., scallops and slipper limpets).

Sensitivity of oysters to variable discharge and salinity is particularly acute in small sub-tropical estuaries subject to regulated freshwater releases. South Florida has sub-tropical estuaries where watershed flood control sometimes results in excessive freshwater inflow to estuaries during the wet season (May-Oct) and reduced discharge and increased salinities in the dry season (Nov-Apr). The potential to reserve freshwater accumulated during the wet season could offer the capacity to regulate freshwater at different temporal scales, thus optimizing salinity conditions for estuarine biota. The goal of this study was to use simulation modeling to explore the effects of freshwater inflows and salinity on adult oyster survival in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) in southwest Florida. Water managers derived three different freshwater inflow scenarios for the CRE based on historical and modified watershed attributes for the time period of 1965-2000. Three different salinity time series were generated from the inflow scenarios at each of three sites in the lower CRE and used to conduct nine different oyster simulations. Overall, the predicted densities of adult oysters in the upstream site were 3-4 times greater in seasons that experienced reduced freshwater inflow (e.g., increased salinity) with oyster density in the lower estuary much less influenced by the inflows. Potential storage of freshwater reduced the frequency of extreme flows in the wet season and helped to maintain minimum inflow in the dry season near the estuarine mouth. Analyses of inflows indicated that discharges ranging from 0 to 1,500 cfs could promote favorable salinities of 10-25 in the lower CRE depending on wet versus dry season climatic conditions. This range of inflows is similar to that derived in other studies of the CRE and emphasizes the value of simulation models to help prescribe freshwater releases which benefit estuarine biota.",2013-10,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,981-994,,4,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000324633900018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D4WF4WS7,journalArticle,2013,"Richkus, William A.; Menzie, Charles A.",Application of an Ecological Risk Assessment for Evaluation of Alternatives Considered for Restoration of Oysters in Chesapeake Bay: Background and Approach,Human and Ecological Risk Assessment,,1080-7039,10.1080/10807039.2013.767092,,"Oyster populations in Chesapeake Bay, USA, declined precipitously over the past three decades, and on-going efforts to restore the native oysters to former abundance were considered to be ineffective.

An enhanced restoration program that included habitat improvement and stocking would likely increase populations, particularly in areas with lower salinity where disease prevalence was lower. However, population numbers would likely reach a plateau much less than the restoration goal a few years after enhanced restoration efforts ended. A harvest moratorium was predicted to have a smaller positive effect than enhanced restoration.

There have been few theoretical efforts to optimize the physical characteristics of a restored reef patch to achieve high recruitment rates. The delivery of competent larvae to a reef patch is influenced by larval behavior and by physical habitat characteristics such as substrate roughness, patch length, current speed, and water depth. We used a spatial model, the ""hitting-distance"" model, to identify habitat characteristics that will jointly maximize both the settlement probability and the density of recruits on an oyster reef (Crassostrea virginica). Modeled larval behaviors were based on laboratory observations and included turbulence-induced diving, turbulence-induced passive sinking, and neutral buoyancy. Profiles of currents and turbulence were based on velocity profiles measured in coastal Virginia over four different substrates: natural oyster reefs, mud, and deposited oyster and whelk shell. Settlement probabilities were higher on larger patches, whereas average settler densities were higher on smaller patches. Larvae settled most successfully and had the smallest optimal patch length when diving over rough substrates in shallow water. Water depth was the greatest source of variability, followed by larval behavior, substrate roughness, and tidal current speed. This result suggests that the best way to maximize settlement on restored reefs is to construct patches of optimal length for the water depth, whereas substrate type is less important than expected. Although physical patch characteristics are easy to measure, uncertainty about larval behavior remains an obstacle for predicting settlement patterns. The mechanistic approach presented here could be combined with a spatially explicit metapopulation model to optimize the arrangement of reef patches in an estuary or region for greater sustainability of restored habitats.",8/19/13,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,e71506,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323425700061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YQIBHSSC,journalArticle,2013,"Levinton, Jeffrey; Doall, Michael; Allam, Bassem","GROWTH AND MORTALITY PATTERNS OF THE EASTERN OYSTER CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA IN IMPACTED WATERS IN COASTAL WATERS IN NEW YORK, USA",Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.032.0222,,"We monitored cage-based populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica in coastal waters of New York Harbor in 2 phases of sampling, 1 with localities spread out over the New York-New Jersey Harbor area (started 2008) and another with 3 localities within Jamaica Bay (started 2010), all impacted by high nitrogen input, low dissolved oxygen, but over a water quality gradient. Patterns of growth, mortality, condition, and disease were compared with a clean-water site in Shelter Island, NY, sampled in parallel with both sampling phases. In both studies, oyster mortality in the urban sites increased dramatically during and after the second summer growth season. Mortality also increased at the same time period at the cleanwater site, but to a much smaller degree. One instance of high mortality in the Lower Hudson was caused by MSX; but, otherwise, no known diseases were identified as the main cause of the sudden mortality increases. Our results suggest that a general effect of reduced water quality had a cumulative effect on the New York Harbor-emplaced oysters, which culminated in high mortality, mainly at the end of the second summer growing season. Despite the increased mortality, other factors such as soft tissue growth and reproduction were not reduced in the harbor sites relative to the clean-water control site. The vulnerability of oysters grown in impacted waters may have to be factored in attempts to restore oysters to impacted harbor waters.",2013-08,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,417-427,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000331516100022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DHCSL9GZ,journalArticle,2013,"Newton, Teresa J.; Vaughn, Caryn C.; Spooner, Daniel E.; Nichols, S.

Because the effects of mussel communities on ecosystem processes result largely from their feeding behavior, we need to understand how they sample and process particulate matter. Our objective was to determine whether measuring a suite of biochemical markers in unionid mussels, from different populations of 2 species (Amblema plicata, Actinonaias ligamentina) across a broad geographical range (4 North American rivers), would help identify their primary dietary sources. Stable isotope data were able to differentiate mussels among rivers, and sometimes species. Data on delta N-15 revealed that mussels fed across trophic levels but that diet varied with habitat and perhaps species. Although mussels contained the same types of fatty acids regardless of river or species, we nonetheless observed considerable variation in essential fatty acid content across rivers. Essential fatty acid profiles were dominated consistently by arachidonic acid. Source-specific fatty acid biomarkers suggested that bacterial and detrital resources might be as important as algae in many habitats. In summary, biochemical metrics differed more among rivers than between species. This suggests that mussels are either considerably adaptable in their dietary requirements or that they feed nonselectively. Understanding nutritional profiles in mussels will help restore unionid communities, which may lead to the reestablishment of their critical role as nutrient recyclers in freshwater food webs.",2013-08,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,497-507,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000331516100029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9Q64D2KZ,journalArticle,2013,"Wilberg, Michael J.; Wiedenmann, John R.; Robinson, Jason M.",Sustainable exploitation and management of autogenic ecosystem engineers: application to oysters in Chesapeake Bay,Ecological Applications,,1051-0761,10.1890/12-0563.1,,"Autogenic ecosystem engineers are critically important parts of many marine and estuarine systems because of their substantial effect on ecosystem services. Oysters are of particular importance because of their capacity to modify coastal and estuarine habitats and the highly degraded status of their habitats worldwide. However, models to predict dynamics of ecosystem engineers have not previously included the effects of exploitation. We developed a linked population and habitat model for autogenic ecosystem engineers undergoing exploitation. We parameterized the model to represent eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in upper Chesapeake Bay by selecting sets of parameter values that matched observed rates of change in abundance and habitat. We used the model to evaluate the effects of a range of management and restoration options including sustainability of historical fishing pressure, effectiveness of a newly enacted sanctuary program, and relative performance of two restoration approaches. In general, autogenic ecosystem engineers are expected to be substantially less resilient to fishing than an equivalent species that does not rely on itself for habitat. Historical fishing mortality rates in upper Chesapeake Bay for oysters were above the levels that would lead to extirpation. Reductions in fishing or closure of the fishery were projected to lead to long-term increases in abundance and habitat. For fisheries to become sustainable outside of sanctuaries, a substantial larval subsidy would be required from oysters within sanctuaries. Restoration efforts using high-relief reefs were predicted to allow recovery within a shorter period of time than low-relief reefs.

Following dramatic declines in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this species is now the focus of renewed restoration efforts. Restoration is undertaken for brood stock rehabilitation as well as a range of ecosystem services such as filtration; however, these ecosystem services are as yet poorly quantified. We present the first laboratory measurements of filtration rates (FR) for O. lurida, to which we fit a model of FR as a function of dry tissue weight and water temperature. We find that O. lurida has a FR at optimum temperature similar to previously established means across oyster species at 1 g dry tissue weight (DTW), but lower than many Crassostrea species. We also find that the allometric exponent relating FR to DTW in O. lurida is lower than the previously published mean across oyster species. Based on our derived filtration rates and historical data, we estimate the historic impact of filtration by O. lurida in five Pacific coast estuaries. We find that historic O. lurida populations did not have the capacity to filter the full volume of the estuary within the estuary residence time in any of the estuaries examined. This result is primarily driven by the low water temperatures and the short estuary residence times that typify the Pacific coast. We conclude that, unlike Crassostrea virginica Gmelin on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the Olympia oyster was not historically a dominant force in regulating seston concentrations at large scales in Pacific coast estuaries. Given the differences in the ecological role and habitat structure of these two oyster species, we recommend that analogies between them be drawn with caution.

We investigated larval dispersal patterns of eastern oyster in an estuary along the Northern Gulf of Mexico under different simulation scenarios of tidal amplitude and phase, river discharge, wind direction, and larval vertical migration, using a coupled biophysical transport model. We focused on the dispersal of larvae released from the commercially exploited (Cedar Point, CP) and non-exploited (Bon Secour Bay, BSB) oyster populations. We found that high flushing rates through the dominant inlet prevented larval exchange between the commercially exploited and non-exploited populations, resulting in negligible connectivity between them. Variations in tidal amplitude, river discharge and wind direction played a more important role in the amount of larvae retained in Mobile Bay when they are released from CP than from BSB. Under most of the scenarios, larvae from BSB were retained around the spawning area, while larvae from CP showed a predominant westward flow. Net sinking behavior of late-stage larvae increased larval retention in the bay, but physical transport showed a higher impact in the amount of larvae retained.

Clumps of live adult M. modiolus were translocated from nearby natural reefs into cultch with a high profile (elevated cultch), cultch with a low profile (flattened cultch), as well as directly into the seafloor. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that translocated mussel clumps would increase habitat complexity thus accelerating community succession and enhancing natural recruitment of M. modiolus spat. These effects were predicted to be greater on elevated cultch due to greater protection from predators and increased accessibility to food resources. Within the artificial reef array the translocated clumps had a significant positive effect on recruitment compared to cultch without mussels with average densities of spat settled on the translocated M. modiolus clumps ranging from 100 to 200 individuals m(-2) compared to 4 to 52 spat m(-2) on cultch without mussels. Recruitment of M. modiolus spat was also significantly higher on translocated horse mussels when compared to natural reefs where densities of 8-36 spat m(-2) were recorded. Reef elevation appeared to provide some degree of protection from predators but differences in translocated M. modiolus survival on the different elevation treatments were not significant. In total, 223 taxa were recorded 12 months after reef construction. The presence of translocated clumps of M. modiolus was the main driver of the increases in faunal diversity and species abundance. Application of objective criteria to assess the performance of artificial reefs suggested that translocation of M. modiolus clumps alone achieved most of the restoration objectives. Consequently this pilot study demonstrates a straightforward and realistic intervention technique that could be used to kick start the regeneration and expansion of impacted mussel and similar biogenic reefs elsewhere.

In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, the horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) biogenic reefs cover only a fraction of their historical range with the remaining reefs badly damaged and requiring restoration. Previous experimental trials suggest that translocation of horse mussels accelerates reef recovery and has therefore been proposed as a suitable restoration technique. We used a series of coupled hydrodynamic and particle dispersal models to assess larval dispersion from remnant and translocated populations to identify suitable areas for adult live M. modiolus translocation in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. A maximum entropy model (MAXENT) was used to identify if dispersing larvae could reach habitat suitable for adult M. modiolus. From these we predicted if translocated mussels will reseed themselves or be able to act as larval sources for nearby reefs. The dispersal models showed that the remnant M. modiolus populations are largely self-recruiting with little connectivity between them. The majority of larvae settled near the sources and movement was largely dependent on the tides and not influenced by wind or waves. Higher reef elevation resulted in larvae being able to disperse further away from the release point. However, larval numbers away from the source population are likely to be too low for successful recruitment There was also little connectivity between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough as any larvae entering the Lough remained predominantly in the Strangford Narrows. The areas covered by these self-seeding populations are suitable for M. modiolus translocation according to the MAXENT model. As a result of this work and in conjunction with other field work we propose a combination of total protection of all remaining larval sources and small scale translocations onto suitable substrata in each of the identified self-recruiting areas.

For instance, in shallow marine ecosystems, reefs formed by filter-feeding bivalves such as oysters provide complex structure, while simultaneously influencing water column properties (e. g. light availability) through suspension feeding. Although it is well supported that both complex structure and light level can influence trophic interactions individually, both factors are highly variable in shallow marine ecosystems and potentially interact to produce non-additive effects. To explore how the multiple influences of an ecosystem engineer affect trophic interactions, we conducted mesocosm experiments with common estuarine species (i.e. Atlantic croaker and grass shrimp, and blue crab and brown shrimp) to test the effects of habitat context (high complexity oyster reefs vs. structureless bottom) and light level on prey survival. Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus predation on grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio was significantly reduced by the presence of oyster reef structure and was not affected by light level. In contrast, blue crab Callinectes sapidus predation on brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus was influenced by the interaction of habitat context and light level: the presence of oyster reefs reduced brown shrimp survival rates at high light levels, but increased survival in low light. Therefore, predicting how habitat context influences species interactions requires an understanding of both species composition and light level.

Fluxes of O-2, NH4+, NO2+3 and SRP at the restored site were enhanced by at least one order of magnitude during all seasons.

Limited studies from the Cape Lookout system implicate large schooling cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in the devastation of patches of commercially harvested bay scallop via strong density-dependent foraging behavior during migrations through this estuary. However, despite the extensive Atlantic range of R. bonasus, the pervasiveness of their patch-depleting foraging behavior and thus impact on shellfisheries remains unknown outside of North Carolina waters. To further understand the potential impacts of cownose rays on benthic prey and the role of bivalve density in eliciting these impacts, we conducted exclusion and manipulation experiments at two sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico frequented by rays during spring migrations. Despite a correlation in ray abundance with haustorid amphipod (primary natural prey) density at our study sites, we were unable to detect any effect of rays on amphipod densities. In addition, through manipulation of predator access, we determined the main cause of mortality to manipulated patches of hard clams was predation by smaller predators such as Callinectes sapidus and not cownose rays. While cownose rays consume hard clam in other parts of their range, we suggest rays along northern Gulf of Mexico barrier islands may prefer foraging on smaller and thinner-shelled bivalves (e.g., Donax sp.), as well as more abundant amphipod crustaceans. We caution that these preferences may have reduced our ability to detect effects of rays on manipulated prey, and thus future impact experiments should strongly consider the local diet of these predators and explore novel techniques to estimate effects on small crustaceans. Further synchronized experimentation along basin-wide scales may elucidate the environmental factors that determine the severity of cownose ray foraging impacts across their range.

At each site, the nektonic organisms collected on a reef plot were compared with those collected on an adjacent control plot lacking a structurally complex habitat. Nekton abundance was significantly higher on the reef plot compared with the control plot at all 3 sites. Nekton abundance also varied among seasons, with the greatest numbers occurring during summer compared with spring and fall.

Reef plots exhibited significantly greater taxon richness than control plots. The number of taxa present also accumulated over time at a higher rate on the reef plots than on the control plots at 2 of the 3 sites.

Of the sentinel bars sampled since the mid 1980s, our analysis identified 13 bars that were characterized by high juvenile oyster abundance and low variation among years, which makes them prime candidate bars for protection to aid in restoration. A comparison with bars already protected within oyster sanctuaries revealed some overlap (4 total bars in common); however, the 13 bars we identified were found over broader geographical and salinity ranges. Juvenile oyster abundance on this group of 13 prime bars was intercorrelated significantly, suggesting that interannual variability in juvenile oyster abundance affects each region similarly. Significant correlations between the juvenile oyster abundance time series and the Palmer hydrological drought index suggest that variations in wet/dry cycles are the cause of this interannual variability. Our analysis also indicates that the entire oyster population of the northern Chesapeake Bay may respond in similar manner to climate change effects.",2012-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,1023-1031,,4,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000313389200014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KTWGB3CV,journalArticle,2012,"Li, Yaqin; Meseck, Shannon L.; Dixon, Mark S.; Rivara, Karen; Wikfors, Gary H.","TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN PHYTOPLANKTON REMOVAL BY A COMMERCIAL, SUSPENDED EASTERN OYSTER NURSERY AND EFFECTS ON LOCAL PLANKTON DYNAMICS",Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.031.0419,,"Quantitative measurements of phytoplankton removal in a natural setting are needed to evaluate interactions between aquacultured bivalve populations and the surrounding environment.

In general, per-capita fecundity was highest at more inland mesohaline reserves, whereas reproductive potential per square meter and reserve reproductive potential were highest at more seaward polyhaline reserves as a result of a combination of relatively high density, and large oyster size and reserve areas. All 3 reproductive metrics increased in general over time. These results suggest that inland broodstock reserves should be prioritized for stock enhancement/seeding and more seaward reserves for reserve expansion and highlight the need to consider spatiotemporal variation and the scale at which a key demographic rate (fecundity and reproductive potential) is expressed when assessing the efficacy and conservation/restoration targets of marine reserves.",2012-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,1091-1101,,4,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000313389200020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YJGV8B8K,journalArticle,2012,"Soniat, Thomas M.; Klinck, John M.; Powell, Eric N.; Cooper, Nathan; Abdelguerfi, Mahdi; Hofmann, Eileen E.; Dahal, Janak; Tu, Shengru; Finigan, John; Eberline, Benjamin S.; La Peyre, Jerome F.; La Peyre, Megan K.; Qaddoura, Fareed",A SHELL-NEUTRAL MODELING APPROACH YIELDS SUSTAINABLE OYSTER HARVEST ESTIMATES: A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LOUISIANA STATE PRIMARY SEED GROUNDS,Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.031.0421,,"A numerical model is presented that defines a sustainability criterion as no net loss of shell, and calculates a sustainable harvest of seed (<75 mm) and sack or market oysters (>= 75 mm).

The rapid decline in reef recruitment post-construction is likely related to three processes: (i) shell degradation by taphonomic processes, (ii) biofouling that occludes the shell surface to recruitment, and (iii) inability of extant oysters on the reef to produce new shell at a rate commensurate with losses to (i) and (ii). There appears to be a requirement for continued replenishment activity to maintain the shell base on these reefs, contrary to the dynamics of a healthy natural oyster population.

We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US.

However, because of improvements in water quality, the potential exists to reintroduce this ecologically extinct species to the ecosystem. For over a decade, New York/New Jersey Baykeeper has conducted oyster restoration activities in support of target ecological goals proposed in the HRE Comprehensive Restoration Plan (CRP). The critical research question is whether existing conditions at a proposed restoration site can actually support long-term Eastern Oyster survival. To determine the feasibility of restoring this native species in Keyport Harbor, New Jersey, juvenile oysters were placed in research field plots, and survivorship and growth were monitored. Data from the first reported oyster restoration research in the New Jersey (NJ) portion of the HRE indicate that oysters could indeed be reintroduced into the ecosystem. After 11 months in situ, research oyster survival rates as high as 60% were observed. Qualitative tissue observations indicated female oysters produced eggs that appeared normal and were ready for spawning. Biodiversity of species collected from the field plots was two-to threefold greater with adult research oysters present, suggesting that oysters increased the density and abundance of other marine species. Sediment deposition patterns indicated that the presence of oysters in support structures may reduce the degree of topographic relief caused by winter storm energies. The research ended abruptly on August 9, 2010, when New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection rescinded the project permit because of concerns that research oysters were beginning to reach New Jersey's market size of 2.5 inches. Although initial data suggest that oysters can survive and reproduce in Raritan Bay and the potential exists to achieve oyster restoration goals included in the CRP, the project also highlights the current lack of agreement between shellfishery regulators and restoration practitioners with respect to oyster reintroduction in waters where shellfish harvesting is currently prohibited. Different shellfish management approaches are used in New England states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut), where local control is an important management tool, and in Chesapeake Bay states (Maryland and Virginia), where federal involvement is relatively high.

Here we reexamine the extent to which prey items in the diet of F. humteria are distributed in preference hierarchies to update the natural history data on this molluscan predator. We tested F. hunteria's preference between oysters, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), and snails, Urosalpinx cinerea (Say), two ecologically co-occurring prey items that require different attack behaviors to subdue. Based on cost benefit analyses, U. cinerea is more energetically profitable than C. virginica, so we predicted that it should be favored by tulip snails. We offered both prey simultaneously to F. hunteria in a Y maze to test this hypothesis. Despite the vast differences between the prey items in terms of potential biomass reward, handling times, and risk to the predator. F. hunteria did not prefer either C. virginica or U. cinerea, live or crushed. Our results suggest F. hunteria has no strong preferences among prey items in its diet, and is an opportunistic predator.

We identify five parameters descriptive of basic characteristics of the shell carbonate budget of a reef that limit simulation accuracy. Two describe the TAZ (taphonomically-active zone) and the distribution of shell carbonate within it. One is the taphonomic rate in the TAZ. Two determine the volume contribution of shell carbonate and the taphonomic loss rate within the reef framework. For Mid-Atlantic estuaries, model simulations suggest that reef accretion only occurs if oyster abundance is near carrying capacity. Simulations further suggest that reef accretion is infeasible for any estuarine reach where dermo is a controlling influence on population dynamics. We forecast that the oyster disease dermo is a principal antagonist of reef persistence through its ability to limit shell addition. Model simulations suggest that reefs with inadequate shell addition 'protect themselves' by limiting the volumetric content of shell carbonate in the TAZ. Thus, a dominant process is the transient expansion and contraction of the shell resource, otherwise termed cultch, within the TAZ, rarely expanding enough to generate reef accretion, yet rarely contracting enough to foster erosion of the reef framework. The loss of framework carbonate thusly is curtailed during periods when the surficial shell layer deteriorates. Stasis, a reef neither accreting nor eroding, is a preferred state. Reef recession requires an inordinately unbalanced shell carbonate budget. Results strongly argue for expanded focus on the dynamics of the shell resource within the TAZ, as this likely fosters a feedback loop with abundance through recruitment, serves as the protective layer for the reef during periods of reef stasis, and establishes the threshold conditions for reef accretion and recession. Model simulations suggest that attaining maximum sustainable yield and maintaining a biomass capable of supporting sufficient shell production for reef accretion are irreconcilable goals over a large component of the oyster's range. Reef stasis would appear to be the only achievable restoration goal in Mid-Atlantic estuarine reaches where dermo holds sway. Exploitation rates much above 5% of the fishable stock per year restrict availability of surficial shell and foster reef erosion.

From 2006 to 2008, average oyster recruitment and total density increased 15- and fivefold, respectively. The unprecedentedly high oyster densities in certain reserves (up to 6,500/m(2) at the end of the study) modified demographic rates such that further density increases were regulated by density-dependent survival. Oyster demographic rates varied significantly among reserves at relatively small spatial scales (20 km). Certain reserves were the strong ""recruiters,"" others the fast ""growers,"" and yet others the high ""survivors."" Cohort dynamics altered the demographic rank order such that the demographically ""best"" reserves varied intra- and interannually. From a management perspective, the prevalence of density-dependent survival suggests that the oysters in this system are habitat rather than recruitment limited, which may minimize the utility of stock enhancement programs. Addition of habitat (i.e., artificial reefs) should focus on reserves characterized by high recruitment but density-dependent growth and survival. This study (1) supports the efficacy of marine reserves in rapidly increasing the density and age-size structure of protected species, (2) highlights the need for spatially explicit demographic data to support multifaceted management objectives, and (3) when combined with evidence of reserve larval connectivity, provides support for applying metapopulation concepts to this reserve system.",2012,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,605-627,,1,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000312007400047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,U9BNSAX7,journalArticle,2012,"Thompson, Christine M.; York, Richard H.; Gallager, Scott M.",Species-specific abundance of bivalve larvae in relation to biological and physical conditions in a Cape Cod estuary,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,0171-8630,10.3354/meps09998,,"Physical and biological conditions impact recruitment and adult population structure of marine invertebrates by affecting early life-history processes from spawning to post-settlement.

Higher survival in 2009 than in 2007, as determined by number of pediveligers, was likely due to higher temperatures and greater food availability during the peak abundance months of July and August in 2009.

Mass loss over a 2-wk period was used to measure dissolution rate on 3 shell legacies: fresh, weathered, and dredged. We found that pH and shell legacy had significant effects on shell dissolution rate, with lower pH increasing dissolution rate. Fresh shell had the highest dissolution rate, followed by weathered then dredged shell. Dissolution rates were significantly different among all 4 pH treatments, except between the lowest (similar to 7.2) and the next lowest (similar to 7.4); however, shells lost mass even under noncorrosive conditions (similar to 7.9).

Reefs provide structure and refuge for juvenile fish and crustaceans, and may be loci for predator foraging. However, reef morphology influences the relative value of refuge and forage functions, and reef utilization by benthic, epibenthic, and nektonic organisms. Reef fragmentation increases the edge to interior ratio, and may enhance use by organisms that favor edge regions, or decrease use by species requiring more interior habitat. The influence of fragmentation was examined using created intertidal oyster reefs and natural reef patches in southeastern North Carolina. Experimental treatments included created reefs (uniform circular reefs, small fragmented reefs, and large fragmented reefs) reference natural reefs, and open mudflat areas. Naturally occurring uniform and fragmented patch reefs in two nearby tidal creeks were also sampled. Following construction of created reefs, all treatments were sampled quarterly over two years, targeting infauna, epifauna, and nekton. Effects of fragmentation on infauna were variable, with a combination of positive and negative species-specific responses. For the vast majority of epi-benthic macrofauna collected from excavations and Breder traps, no effect of small-scale fragmentation on utilization was observed. Preferential use of large fragmented reefs over small fragmented reefs was observed for two species, Lagodon rhomboides and Panopeus herbstii, suggesting that the small fragmented reefs may have been below the patch size threshold at which edge effects become beneficial. Our results suggest that, at least at the scale investigated here, multiple small reefs may provide similar habitat benefits to a single, larger oyster reef. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recent restoration successes and field experiments indicate that high-relief reefs persist, likely due to elevated reef height which offsets heavy sedimentation and promotes oyster survival, disease resistance and growth, in contrast to low-relief reefs which degrade in just a few years. These findings suggest the existence of alternative stable states in oyster reef populations. We developed a mathematical model consisting of three differential equations that represent volumes of live oysters, dead oyster shells (=accreting reef), and sediment. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations demonstrated that multiple nonnegative equilibria can exist for live oyster, accreting reef and sediment volume at an ecologically reasonable range of parameter values; the initial height of oyster reefs determined which equilibrium was reached. This investigation thus provides a conceptual framework for alternative stable states in native oyster populations, and can be used as a tool to improve the likelihood of success in restoration efforts.

We performed three mesocosm experiments to simultaneously examine the contrasting effects of nutrient loading and historic suspension-feeding bivalve densities on the growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina), juvenile bivalves (northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; and bay scallops, Argopecten irradians), and juvenile planktivorous fish (sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus). High nutrient loading rates led to significantly higher phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) levels in all experiments, significantly increased growth of juvenile bivalves relative to controls with lower nutrient loading rates in two experiments, and significantly reduced the growth of eelgrass in one experiment. The filtration provided by adult suspension feeders (M. mercenaria and C. virginica) significantly decreased phytoplankton levels in all experiments, significantly increased light penetration and the growth of eelgrass in one experiment, and significantly decreased the growth of juvenile bivalves and fish in two experiments, all relative to controls with no filtration from adult suspension feeders. These results demonstrate that an appropriate level of nutrient loading can have a positive effect on some estuarine resources and that bivalve filtration can mediate the effects of nutrient loading to the benefit or detriment of different estuarine resources.

Oyster reefs offer diverse ecological and social services for people and natural environments; unfortunately, reefs are also highly sensitive to impairment from natural and human-induced disasters. Understanding the resilience of oyster reef communities to disturbance is key to developing effective conservation and restoration plans. Florida's Big Bend coastline (Gulf of Mexico coast from Crystal River to Apalachee Bay) supports large expanses of oyster reef habitat that have existed for thousands of years in a region that is one of the most pristine coastal zones in the continental US. We assessed trends in oyster habitat along the Big Bend region between 1982 and 2011 by examining changes in areal extent and distance of oyster reefs from shore. During our study period, we found a 66% net loss of oyster reef area (124.05 ha) with losses concentrated on offshore (88%), followed by nearshore (61%), and inshore reefs (50%). We also found that the spatial distribution of oyster reefs was moving inland. This rapid loss is likely a departure from historic geological succession. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the primary mechanism for these observed losses in oyster reefs is reduced survival and recruitment, likely a result of decreased freshwater inputs which increases existing reef vulnerability to wave action and sea level rise. Once oyster reef substrate becomes unconsolidated and the nucleation site is lost, the regeneration of the oyster reef may not be reversible through natural processes. To test these predictions, we recommend restoration-based experiments to elicit the mechanisms of decline in order to foster long-term sustainability of estuarine habitat critical to oysters.",2011-10,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,UNSP 114,,10,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000208811100008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,V8BUKDAX,journalArticle,2011,"Michaelis, Adriane; Lane, Hillary; Politano, Vincent; Allen, Steve; Meritt, Donald; Paynter, Kennedy",EVIDENCE FOR DENSITY-DEPENDENT SURVIVAL OF CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA SPAT ON RESTORED OYSTER BARS IN THE NORTHERN CHESAPEAKE BAY,Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,,,,2011-08,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,532-532,,2,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000294312200209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9W4ULLUK,journalArticle,2011,"Levinton, Jeffrey; Doall, Michael; Ralston, David; Starke, Adam; Allam, Bassem","Climate Change, Precipitation and Impacts on an Estuarine Refuge from Disease",Plos One,,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0018849,,"Background: Oysters play important roles in estuarine ecosystems but have suffered recently due to overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss. A tradeoff between growth rate and disease prevalence as a function of salinity makes the estuarine salinity transition of special concern for oyster survival and restoration. Estuarine salinity varies with discharge, so increases or decreases in precipitation with climate change may shift regions of low salinity and disease refuge away from optimal oyster bottom habitat, negatively impacting reproduction and survival. Temperature is an additional factor for oyster survival, and recent temperature increases have increased vulnerability to disease in higher salinity regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined growth, reproduction, and survival of oysters in the New York Harbor-Hudson River region, focusing on a low-salinity refuge in the estuary. Observations were during two years when rainfall was above average and comparable to projected future increases in precipitation in the region and a past period of about 15 years with high precipitation. We found a clear tradeoff between oyster growth and vulnerability to disease. Oysters survived well when exposed to intermediate salinities during two summers (2008, 2010) with moderate discharge conditions. However, increased precipitation and discharge in 2009 reduced salinities in the region with suitable benthic habitat, greatly increasing oyster mortality. To evaluate the estuarine conditions over longer periods, we applied a numerical model of the Hudson to simulate salinities over the past century. Model results suggest that much of the region with suitable benthic habitat that historically had been a low salinity refuge region may be vulnerable to higher mortality under projected increases in precipitation and discharge. Conclusions/Significance: Predicted increases in precipitation in the northeastern United States due to climate change may lower salinities past important thresholds for oyster survival in estuarine regions with appropriate substrate, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics and impeding oyster restoration efforts, especially in the Hudson estuary where a large basin constitutes an excellent refuge from disease.",4/28/11,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,e18849,,4,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290020700005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,U2TDE687,journalArticle,2011,"Thompson, Peter C.; Rosenthal, Benjamin M.; Hare, Matthew P.",An evolutionary legacy of sex and clonal reproduction in the protistan oyster parasite Perkinsus marinus,Infection Genetics and Evolution,,1567-1348,10.1016/j.meegid.2011.01.008,,"Perkinsus marinus, a protozoan parasite of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, causes Dermo disease which limits fecundity and causes high mortality in host populations. The long-term efficacy of management strategies for suppressing this disease in both aquaculture and restoration settings depends on the potential rate of evolutionary response by P. marinus. Sexual reproduction has never been demonstrated in vitro or in previous population genetic studies. We developed high resolution microsatellite markers and amplified alleles directly from infected oyster genomic DNA. Of 336 infected oysters from four populations between Massachusetts and Florida, 129 (48%) appeared to be infected with a single parasite genotype and were subjected to population genetic analyses assuming diploidy. The great diversity of multilocus genotypes observed is incompatible with strictly clonal reproduction. Substantial heterozygote deficits in three populations suggest that sexual reproduction often involves inbreeding. At the same time, significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium occurred in most sampled populations, and several genotypes were sampled repeatedly in each of two populations, indicating that asexual reproduction also occurs in P. marinus populations. Interestingly, where this parasite has recently expanded its range, lower strain diversity, significant heterozygote excess, and highly heterozygous multilocus genotypes suggests clonal propagation of recent recombinants. Taken together, these data suggest that P. marinus employs multiple reproductive modes, and that over the short term, selection acts upon independent parasite lineages rather than upon individual loci in a cohesive, interbreeding population. Nevertheless, high genotypic diversity is the evolutionary legacy of sex in P. marinus. Anthropogenic movement of infected oysters may increase outcrossing opportunities, potentially facilitating rapid evolution of this parasite. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Models and data analysis have shown that as much as 90% of nutrient and TSS inputs to the WRR enter via inflowing tidal water from the Chesapeake Bay; therefore, community outreach efforts are predicted to have little impact on water quality. Three alternative designs have been identified that have the potential to decrease turbidity and stimulate growth in subaquatic vegetation (SAV): addition of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria), and living shoreline restoration (LSR).

Among the many potential factors that could affect efforts to produce oysters through aquaculture or supplementation of shell beds is substratum condition. The present study examined larval setting on field-produced biofilms from Little Wicomico River (Virginia, USA) to assess whether bacterial community structure (examined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, T-RFLP) or other characteristics of contemporary biofilms in this tributary (biofilm age and mass, algal abundance, and percentage organic matter) inhibited setting of larval oysters. The structure of the natural and heterogenous bacterial community in the biofilms and the success of oyster set were correlated, suggesting that specific microbial species may play a role in oyster setting. Larval set increased with biofilm age and mass, suggesting that established field-produced biofilms have no inhibitory effect. In contrast, the percentage of organic matter was negatively correlated with oyster set, whereas chlorophyll a concentration had no observed effect. The study expands prior knowledge by providing a more realistic timeframe for biofilm development (weeks as opposed to days), recounting effects of biofilms that are more representative of the natural dynamic and disturbance processes that would be expected to occur on submerged structures, and by incorporating seasonal and spatial variation. An important negative effect observed during the study period was heavy predation by Stylochus ellipticus on newly set oysters. Overall, the results of this study, which is the first assessment of the effects of biofilms produced naturally within a Chesapeake Bay tributary, suggest that the absence of large numbers of oysters in Little Wicomico River is not related to microbes or other specific characteristics of biofilms that develop on suitable setting substrata, but rather to heavy predation of newly set larvae.",2011,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,255-265,,3,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288267300002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PX5C9VYB,journalArticle,2011,"Higgins, Colleen B.; Stephenson, Kurt; Brown, Bonnie L.",Nutrient Bioassimilation Capacity of Aquacultured Oysters: Quantification of an Ecosystem Service,Journal of Environmental Quality,,0047-2425,10.2134/jeq2010.0203,,"Like many coastal zones and estuaries, the Chesapeake Bay has been severely degraded by cultural eutrophication. Rising implementation costs and difficulty achieving nutrient reduction goals associated with point and nonpoint sources suggests that approaches supplemental to source reductions may prove useful in the future. Enhanced oyster aquaculture has been suggested as one potential policy initiative to help rid the Bay waters of excess nutrients via harvest of bioassimilated nutrients. To assess this potential, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and total carbon (TC) content were measured in oyster tissue and shell at two floating-raft cultivation sites in the Chesapeake Bay. Models were developed based on the common market measurement of total length (TL) for aquacultured oysters, which was strongly correlated to the TN (R-2 = 0.76), TP (R-2 = 0.78), and TC (R-2 = 0.76) content per oyster tissue and shell. These models provide resource managers with a tool to quantify net nutrient removal. Based on model estimates, 10(6) harvestsized oysters (76 mm TL) remove 132 kg TN, 19 kg TP, and 3823 kg TC. In terms of nutrients removed per unit area, oyster harvest is an effective means of nutrient removal compared with other nonpoint source reduction strategies. At a density of 286 oysters m(-2), assuming no mortality, harvestsize nutrient removal rates can be as high as 378 kg TN ha(-1), 54 kg TP ha(-1), and 10,934 kg TC ha(-1) for 76-mm oysters.

Oysters grown in floating structures are subsequently planted in bays, where they continue to live, grow, and spawn; filter the water; contribute to the larval pool; and provide habitat. Our study is one of the first evaluations of habitat value provided by floating oyster gardens in a degraded mid-Atlantic estuary. Oyster growth and survival within the floats was monitored in a eutrophic, turbid, periodically hypoxic, soft-bottom coastal lagoon system. We examined the abundance and diversity of fishes and invertebrates with respect to 3 replicated treatments: live oyster clusters, disarticulated oyster shell, and a float with no shells or oysters. We also studied the effects of 2 cleaning frequencies (biweekly and monthly) on species assemblages, and the growth and survival of oysters, and monitored basic water quality parameters. The species assemblages in floats with oyster clusters were very similar to those with loose shell but considerably different than that of empty floats. Cleaning frequency (biweekly and monthly) did not affect the growth or survival of oysters. Location of floats within the canal system, however, was a large determinant of oyster vital rates as well as community structure. Forty-nine species of fishes and invertebrates, and 8 species of macroalgae were collected from floating oyster gardens, including 9 commercial or recreational fishery species, many of which are likely habitat limited in the Inland Bays because of the loss of tidal wetlands, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds. Newly settled juvenile oysters have been found for the first time within the floating oyster gear in the manmade, residential canal systems.

Alternatively, we have shown that intertidal oyster reefs are remarkably resilient and may occur in greater abundance today than when first documented in 1891. Rather than a collapse of oyster stocks, declining trends in fishery landings reflect the social and economic challenges associated with an unsustainable canning industry during the early 20th century. In addition, we challenge the axiom that the condition of existing intertidal reef habitat has deteriorated. Areas of shell deposits attributed to exhausted beds in historical assessments may in fact represent naturally occurring coastal features. Nonetheless, enhancement and conservation efforts are worthy efforts, because intertidal oyster habitat increases the health and resiliency of coastal Georgia by providing essential fish habitat, flood control, erosion abatement, and pollution reduction services.

In this study, we examined oyster habitat development at five community-based oyster restoration sites in South Carolina using oyster population parameters, resident fauna densities, and sedimentation (percent sediment coverage) as assessment metrics. All sites included multiple-aged reefs (1-3 years old) at the time of the fall 2004 sampling. Resident crabs and mussels were abundant at all five sites and crab assemblages were related to the size structure of the oyster microhabitat. Scorched mussel (Brachidontes exustus) abundances were most frequently correlated with oyster and other resident species abundances. Associations among oysters and resident crabs and mussels were not evident when analyses were conducted with higher level taxonomic groupings (e.g., total number of crabs, mussels, or oysters), indicating that species-level identifications improve our understanding of interactions among reef inhabitants and oyster populations. Community-based restoration sites in South Carolina provide habitat for mussels and resident crabs, in some cases in the absence of dense populations of relatively large oysters.

Although oyster shells were discarded as trash after the oysters were eaten, the environmental and ecological data recorded in the bivalve geochemistry during shell deposition remain intact over centuries, thereby providing a unique window into conditions during the earliest Jamestown years. We compare oxygen isotope data from these 17th century oyster shells with modern shells to quantify and contrast estuarine salinity, season of oyster collection, and shell provenance during Jamestown colonization (1609-1616) and the 21st century. Data show that oysters were collected during an extended drought between fall 1611 and summer 1612. The drought shifted the 14 psu isohaline above Jamestown Island, facilitating individual oyster growth and extension of oyster habitat upriver toward the colony, thereby enhancing local oyster food resources.

Because ecosystems provide diverse human and ecological benefits, achieving one restoration benefit may take place at the expense of other benefits. This poses challenges when attempting to allocate limited resources to optimally achieve multiple benefits, and when defining measures of restoration success. We present a restoration decision-support tool that links ecosystem prediction and human use in a flexible ""optimization"" framework that clarifies important restoration trade-offs, makes location-specific recommendations, predicts benefits, and quantifies the associated costs (in the form of lost opportunities). The tool is illustrated by examining restoration options related to the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, which supported an historically important fishery in Chesapeake Bay and provides a range of ecosystem services such as removing seston, enhancing water clarity, and creating benthic habitat. We use an optimization approach to identify the locations where oyster restoration efforts are most likely to maximize one or more benefits such as reduction in seston, increase in light penetration, spawning stock enhancement, and harvest, subject to funding constraints and other limitations. This proof-of-concept Oyster Restoration Optimization model (ORO) incorporates predictions from three-dimensional water quality (nutrients-phytoplankton-zooplankton detritus [NPZD] with oyster filtration) and larval transport models; calculates size- and salinity-dependent growth, mortality, and fecundity of oysters; and includes economic costs of restoration efforts. Model results indicate that restoration of oysters in different regions of the Chesapeake Bay would maximize different suites of benefits due to interactions between the physical characteristics of a system and nonlinear biological processes. For example, restoration locations that maximize harvest are not the same as those that would maximize spawning stock enhancement. Although preliminary, the ORO model demonstrates that our understanding of circulation patterns, single-species population dynamics and their interactions with the ecosystem can be integrated into one quantitative framework that optimizes spending allocations and provides explicit advice along with testable predictions.

A local Standard oyster strain was used as a reference control, and selected oysters belonged to disease-tolerant DEBY and CROSBreed strains. Initial deployment was in September 2003, during a period of unusually low salinity. Mean river salinities during the first 2 y were 8.5 parts per thousand and 9.0 parts per thousand, respectively, but these rose to historically typical levels of 11.5 parts per thousand and 11.3 parts per thousand during the third and fourth years.

Oysters grew well during most of the study, except at the upriver station, where salinities were less than 5 parts per thousand during much of the first year. The DEBY strain showed the best overall growth and survival. Standard and CROS Breed strains were similar in both growth and survival, and did not perform as well as DEBYs.

P. marinus infections among sympatric feral oysters (the probable source of disseminated cells infecting SPF oysters), were low during all years at the upriver site, but increased each year with increasing salinities at the downriver sites.

In response, laboratory-reared spat and juvenile oysters have been raised in specialized facilities and then placed on restored bars. The relative efficacy of this technique versus other methods for growing juvenile oysters remains unknown. In this study, work was performed to determine biological response and hydrodynamic design techniques to specify vertically oriented oyster farming structures. The study was conducted considering sites in the upper Chesapeake Bay. To assess biological response, oyster growth rates in trays deployed at 0.5 m increments were measured over a nine-month period at a representative location with a depth of 3.5 m. The growth of the oysters was compared with those placed in trays on a nearby restored bar (depth of 2 m). Although oyster loss was substantial in trays deployed at depths of 0.5 and 1.0 m, changes in oyster height over the course of the experiment (0.06 mm d(-1)) did not differ significantly among depth treatments or between the vertical trays and those on the restored bar. This indicates that the deployment of vertical arrays of trays with a minimal depth of 1.0 m may efficiently utilize the water column to grow out juvenile C. virginica. To develop hydrodynamic design techniques, a series of full scale tests was conducted with a stack of trays with oyster shells at the U.S. Naval Academy, Hydromechanics Laboratory. The stack of trays was subjected to steady tow velocities and oscillatory flows to examine drag and inertia force characteristics as a function of both Reynolds and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers. With force coefficient results, a loading scheme was developed for a prototype oyster grow out structure by applying Stoke's second order wave theory and the Morison equation. Environmental conditions representative of the Severn River (Annapolis, MD, USA) were used in the analysis and consisted of waves with a height of I m and a period of 5 s with a current of 0.5 m s(-1).

The demographics of oyster populations that would be required to maintain reef accretion rates commensurate with sea level rise over geological time frames are examined using estimates of oyster longevity in pre-colonial (pre-1600) times combined with parallel estimates of pre-disease endemic mortality. The analysis demonstrates that modern populations, with their disease related, age-truncated demographics, are generally not capable of maintaining and building biogenic reefs through accretion. Estimates of filtration rates associated with Chesapeake Bay oyster populations prior to 1600 considerably underestimate actual benthic-pelagic coupling during that period. Pristine oyster populations would have supported water column turnover rates on the order of minutes to hours. Thus, the spatial footprint of oyster reefs was limited by available productivity in the estuary.

Reefs of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica are a dominant feature of the estuaries along the Southwest Florida coast. Oysters are benthic, sessile, filter-feeding organisms that provide ecosystem services by filtering the water column and providing food, shelter and habitat for associated organisms. As such, the species is an excellent sentinel organism for examining the impacts of restoration on estuarine ecosystems. The implementation of CERP attempts to improve: the hydrology and spatial and structural characteristics of oyster reefs, the recruitment and survivorship of C. virginica, and the reef-associated communities of organisms. This project links biological responses and environmental conditions relative to hydrological changes as a means of assessing positive or negative trends in oyster responses and population trends. Using oyster responses, we have developed a communication tool (i.e., Stoplight Report Card) based on CERP performance measures that can distinguish between responses to restoration and natural patterns. The Stoplight Report Card system is a communication tool that uses Monitoring and Assessment Program (MAP) performance measures to grade an estuary's response to changes brought about by anthropogenic input or restoration activities. The Stoplight Report Card consists of both a suitability index score for each organism metric as well as a trend score (- decreasing trend, +/- no change in trend, and + increasing trend). Based on these two measures, a component score (e.g., living density) is calculated by averaging the suitability index score and the trend score. The final index score is obtained by taking the geometric score of each component, which is then translated into a stoplight color for success (green), caution (yellow), or failure (red). Based on the data available for oyster populations and the responses of oysters in the Caloosahatchee Estuary, the system is currently at stage ""caution."" This communication tool instantly conveys the status of the indicator and the suitability, while trend curves provide information on progress towards reaching a target. Furthermore, the tool has the advantage of being able to be applied regionally, by species, and collectively, in concert with other species, system-wide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to overharvesting and habitat loss, the increasing frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are likely to contribute to bivalve losses, particularly in cases where blooms negatively impact larval stages. This paper reports on the lethal effects of clonal cultures and blooms of Cochlodinium polykrikoides from the US Atlantic coast on the larvae of three species of commercially and ecologically valuable bivalves: the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians), and the Northern quahog (hard clam; Mercenaria mercenaria). Both cultures and blooms of C. polykrikoides were highly toxic to all three species of bivalve larvae causing 80-100% mortality during 24- to 72-h exposures at concentrations of 1-2 x 10(3) cells ml(-1). Toxicity was dependent on cell densities, growth stage of C. polykrikoides (i.e. cultures in exponential stage growth were more toxic than later stages), exposure time of larvae to cells (i.e. longer exposure caused higher mortality), the age of larvae (i.e. younger larvae were more sensitive), and the relative abundance of C. polykrikoides (i.e. the presence of other microalgae decreased toxicity). Free radical-scavenging enzymes (peroxidase and catalase) and the removal of C. polykrikoides cells (i.e. culture filtrate) significantly increased larval survival suggesting toxicity is maximized by contact with live cells and may involve labile toxins bound by these compounds including e.g. reactive oxygen species. The toxicity of C. polykrikoides to bivalve larvae was generally more severe than other HAB species (e.g. Karenia brevis, Karlodinium veneficum, Alexandrium tamarense, Prorocentrum minimum). Since the bivalves in this study spawn in the months when C. polykrikoides blooms on the east coast of North America, these results suggest that these blooms may have detrimental effects on efforts to restore these already diminished populations.",2009-11,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,2601-2611,,12,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000270721000016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GP5S35VN,journalArticle,2009,"Schulte, David M.; Burke, Russell P.; Lipcius, Romuald N.",Unprecedented Restoration of a Native Oyster Metapopulation,Science,,0036-8075,10.1126/science.1176516,,"Native oyster species were once vital ecosystem engineers, but their populations have collapsed worldwide because of overfishing and habitat destruction.

Pollution of mangrove ecosystems puts their future and that of local communities at risk. Only the use of informed and integrative approaches will successfully maintain and restore these valuable ecosystems. 2. Biochemical indicators of organism physiological condition have been widely used to evaluate habitat quality and for early detection of the impact of stressors. Mangrove crabs may be useful bioindicators of the quality of mangrove habitats, as they are characteristic and ecologically important organisms in mangrove environments. 3. The physiological condition (evaluated by the RNA/DNA ratio) of Perisesarma guttatum (Grapsidae) and Uca annulipes (Ocypodidae) was assessed to determine its potential as an indicator of habitat quality in one polluted and two relatively unpolluted Mozambican mangroves, during the rainy and dry seasons. 4. Both species showed seasonal effects on RNA/DNA ratio, but only U. annulipes was significantly affected by pollution. RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes may thus be a useful indicator of pollution and seasonality in mangrove habitats. There was a synergistic negative effect of the rainy season and pollution on the RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes. Due to higher DNA, rather than lower RNA contents, the RNA/DNA ratio of P. guttatum was always significantly lower than that of U. annulipes. 5. The knowledge gathered in this study can be used in integrative strategies, policies and programmes aiming to sustain, maintain and restore mangrove areas, and for the evaluation of mangrove habitat quality.

Increased seston concentrations, which decrease light penetration, are likely one of the main causes of the decline in Chesapeake Bay. It has been hypothesized that dense populations of suspension-feeding bivalves, such as eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), may filter sufficient seston from the water to reduce light attenuation and enhance seagrass growth. Furthermore, eastern oyster populations can form large three-dimensional reef-like structures that may act like breakwaters by attenuating waves, thus decreasing sediment resuspension. We developed a quasi-three-dimensional Seagrass-Waves-Oysters-Light-Seston (SWOLS) model to investigate whether oyster reefs and breakwaters could improve seagrass growth by reducing seston concentrations. Seagrass growth potential (SGP), a parameter controlled by resuspension-induced turbidity, was calculated in simulations in which wave height, oyster abundance, and reef/breakwater configuration were varied. Wave height was the dominant factor influencing SGP, with higher waves increasing sediment resuspension and decreasing SGP. Submerged breakwaters parallel with the shoreline improved SGP in the presence of 0.2 and 0.4 m waves when sediment resuspension was dominated by wave action, while submerged groins perpendicular to the shoreline improved SGP under lower wave heights (0.05 and 0.1 m) when resuspension was dominated by along-shore tidal currents. Oyster-feeding activity did not affect SGP, due to the oysters' distance from the seagrass bed and reduced oyster filtration rates under either low or high sediment concentrations. Although the current implementation of the SWOLS model has simplified geometry, the model does demonstrate that the interaction between oyster filtration and along-shore circulation, and between man-made structures and wave heights, should be considered when managing seagrass habitats, planning seagrass restoration projects, and choosing the most suitable methods to protect shorelines from erosion.",2009-07,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,748-757,,4,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000266815300012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,83U9JBCL,journalArticle,2009,"Johnson, Marthew W.; Powers, Sean P.; Senne, Joseph; Park, Kyeong",ASSESSING IN SITU TOLERANCES OF EASTERN OYSTERS (CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA) UNDER MODERATE HYPOXIC REGIMES: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESTORATION,Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/035.028.0202,,"Increases in the frequency and duration of hypoxia and the loss of biogenic reefs are two of the most prominent environmental insults to estuaries.

Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, Such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners have used a broad range of nonmutually exclusive approaches, including: (1) oyster gardening of hatchery-produced oysters; (2) deployment of juvenile to adult shellfish (""broodstock"") within designated areas for stock enhancement; and (3) substrate enhancement using natural or recycled man-made materials loose or in ""bags"" designed to enhance local settlement success. Many of these approaches are inspired by fishery-enhancement efforts or the past, though are implemented with different outcomes in mind (ecological services vs. fishery outcomes).

Although different oyster species rarely exceed the internationally adopted regulatory level for shellfish harvesting closures (20 mu g g(-1)), these are often applied to all bivalve species in an affected area. This study examines the influence of diet composition and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cell size, density and toxicity on oyster feeding rates to determine potential pre-ingestive mechanisms that may lead to low DA accumulation in the oysters Crassostrea virginica. Clearance rate (CR) and pseudofeces production of juvenile oysters were quantified under varying laboratory conditions representative of natural Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. Oysters filtered increasing amounts of P. multiseries cells as cell density increased, but ingestion was limited by pseudofeces production at concentrations > 10 400 cells ml(-1) (ca. 6 mg dry weight l(-1)). Oysters significantly reduced their CR when fed both toxic and non-toxic P. multiseries clones in unialgal suspensions compared to Isochrysis galbana, and this rapid grazing inhibition was not related to growth stage, cell size, or exposure time. When offered mixed suspensions containing equivalent cellular volumes of the 2 species, however, relatively high CR was restored. Therefore, we suggest that DA intake by oysters from mono-specific Pseudo-nitzschia blooms would be limited by a persistently reduced CR and rejection of cells in pseudofeces. When an alternative, good source of food is present in a mixed phytoplankton assemblage with R multiseries, no CR inhibition is expected and DA intake will be regulated by pre-ingestive particle selection on the feeding organs, as demonstrated in Mafra et al.

The sanctuaries have been in existence from 3 to 30 yr; 10 sanctuaries protect constructed ('restored') oyster reefs and 1 sanctuary protects natural reefs. Measurements of vertical relief, live oyster density, recruitment, abundance of market-sized oysters, and biomass as well as disease prevalence and severity indicated that 7 of the 11 sanctuaries met criteria for minimal success by having vertical relief >20 cm in height, living oysters (>10 oysters m(-2)), and evidence of recent recruitment in 1. of 2 yr of the survey.

This ecosystem service has been often touted as a major reason for many oyster restoration efforts, but empirical characterization and quantification of seston removal rates in the field have been lacking. Changes in chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the water column were measured in May 2005 and June 2006 in South Carolina using in situ fluorometry and laboratory analysis of pumped water samples taken upstream and downstream as water flowed over natural and constructed intertidal oyster reefs. Both methods gave similar results overall, but with wide variability within individual reef datasets. In situ fluorometer data logged at 10 to 30-s intervals for up to 1.3 h over eight different reefs (three natural and five constructed) showed total removal (or uptake) expressed as % removal of chl a ranging from -9.8% to 27.9%, with a mean of 12.9%. Our data indicate that restored shellfish reefs should provide water-quality improvements soon after construction, and the overall impact is probably determined by the size and density of the resident filter feeder populations relative to water flow characteristics over the reef. The measured population-level chl a removal was converted to mean individual clearance rates to allow comparison with previous laboratory studies. Although direct comparisons could not be made due to the small size of oysters on the study reefs (mean shell height, 36.1 mm), our calculated rates (mean, 1.21 L h-1) were similar to published laboratory measured rates for oysters of this size. However, the wide variability in measured removal by the oyster reefs suggests that individual oyster feeding rates in nature may be much more variable than in the laboratory. The proliferation of ecosystem-level models that simulate the impacts of bivalves on water quality based only on laboratory-feeding measurements underscores the importance of further research aimed at determining ecologically realistic feeding rates for oysters in the field.

Across years and populations, condition at the end of fall explained similar to 89% of the variance in spring peak condition. Consistent differences in condition through time among some populations suggested that location within the bay as well as clam size impact condition. Because of interannual and locational variability, long-term monitoring of this long-lived species is essential for determining factors affecting condition and reproduction, and the ultimate restoration os sustainable hard clam populations.",2008-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,1069-1080,,5,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000261712200001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TUCIHJV9,journalArticle,2008,"Harding, Juliana M.; Mann, Roger; Southworth, Melissa J.","SHELL LENGTH-AT-AGE RELATIONSHIPS IN JAMES RIVER, VIRGINIA, OYSTERS (CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA) COLLECTED FOUR CENTURIES APART",Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,10.2983/0730-8000-27.5.1109,,"Eastern oysters were ecologically and structurally dominant features of the Chesapeake Bay prior to European colonization.

In January 2004, eight oyster reefs (325 m(2) each) were constructed in each of three areas of Mobile Bay (Cedar Point, Sand Reef, and Shellbank), which varied in water quality and spatial extent of existing oyster reefs. Four reefs were high relief (>= 1.0 m vertical relief) and four were high relief (0.1, 0.2 m). Semiannual quadrat surveys and monthly assessments of oyster survivorship were designed to evaluate oyster recruitment, abundance and mortality as a function of reef elevation and location. The two most abundant sessile invertebrartes found in the quadrat sampling were eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and recurved mussel (Ischadium recurvum). Recurved mussels were abundant on all restored reefs, but densities did not significantly vary with location or reef elevation. Oyster recruitment and abundace varied by location (Cedar Point > Sand Reef > Shellbank). Oyster recruitment was also higher on high relief reefs compared with low relief.

Introducing the Asian oyster, C. ariakensis, into Chesapeake Bay has been proposed to help restore an oyster population to historical levels, to enhance the Bay ecosystem, and to contribute to the revival of the commercial oyster fishery. The population of the indigenous C. virginica has declined dramatically throughout the bay in part as a result of infection by two non-native protozoan parasites that cause MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni) and Dermo (Perkinsus marinus) diseases. Other factors including habitat loss, reduced water quality, and overfishing have also reduced population size. Crassostrea ariakensis is known to be more tolerant to these diseases and thus may have greater potential for survival and growth in Chesapeake Bay than the native oyster. Triploid C. ariakensis and diploid C. virginica were immersed in cages in the vicinity of the CCNPP discharge for two exposure periods between July and December 2004. After retrieval, oysters were analyzed for radionuclide concentrations, growth rate, mortality, disease status, and meat condition. Fouling of oysters and cages was also observed. Quantities of radionuclides released by the CCNPP for both exposure periods were insufficient to produce detectable concentrations in either C. virginica or C. ariakensis, precluding a comparison of uptake of Co58, Co60, or Ag110 m, radionuclides that have been detectable historically. Shell lengths were not significantly different between the two species for the two sampling periods, despite the fact that there were considerable age differences between them, but C. ariakensis did show a greater rate of growth.

Our mortality estimates based on counts of recent boxes consistently differentiated between years with high disease intensity and those with low disease intensity, between wet and dry years, and between salinity zones. In contrast, traditional estimates of yearly mortality based on total box counts often were out of phase with measured levels of disease intensity and weather (dry or wet).

Simple larval swimming behaviors were parameterized for the 2 oyster species with results from preliminary laboratory experiments and literature. To isolate the effect of circulation, settlement habitat, and larval behavior on the spatial trajectories of particles, vertical swimming velocity was the only biological process represented in the model; egg production and larval growth were not included. Differences in larval swimming behavior had significant consequences for particle transport in Chesapeake Bay by influencing dispersal distances, transport success, and the degree of connectivity between 'subpopulations' in different tributaries. Most particles (>96%) did not return to the same reef on which they were released, and there were behavior-dependent differences in spatial patterns of the 'source' and 'sink' characteristics of oyster reefs.

In addition to the ecological services provided by salt marshes, the 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico raised public awareness of the ability of intertidal marshes to reduce personal property damage from storm surges. Since marshes can be destroyed through natural or anthropogenic processes, methods to protect these areas are being developed; one such method is the use of ""living shorelines."" Living shorelines serve multiple roles by controlling erosion, maintaining natural coastal processes, and sustaining biodiversity through land-use management, soft armoring, or combinations of solft and semihard armoring techniques. Living shorelines provide a viable alternative to common hardened structures such as bulkheads, stone revetments, and seawalls. One type of living shoreline was used at Saw Grass Point Salt Marsh on Dauphin Island, Alabama. Dauphin Island's Fort Gaines Harbor was constructed in the 1950s by removing approximately 3 ha from Saw Grass Point Salt Marsh. The harbor now serves as one of Dauphin island's two primary access points for recreational and commercial boats to the Gulf of Mexico. Chronic erosion has resulted in the loss of 0.5 ha of the remaining marsh. This saline tidal marsh is of significant ecological importance and is one of only two on Dauphin Island. In 2004, a community-based restoration grant was used to protect and restore the marsh through the use of exposed nearshore precast concrete breakwaters called Coastal havens. These structures function as detached breakwates to minimize the effect of storm surge and boat wake thhrough wave attennation; they also provide suitable substrate for oyster colonization. These structures were selected over other erosion control technologies, including vertical bulkheads, rock or wooden sills, and headlands. In April 2005, 182 units were installed in two interlocking rows parallel to the east perimeter of the marsh in water approximately 1.3 m deep. Oyster density on the coastal havens, measured 19 months postinstallation, was 205 oysters/m(2). Measurements behind the breakwater indicate some sediment accretiion. The project cost was approximately US$335/m to protect 162m of shoreline. The dual functiion of these structures has controlled the erosion behind the breakwater and has provided habitat for a wide array of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration trust resources, including locally important species such as spotted seatrout (also known as speckled trout) Cynoscion nebulosus, blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and Gulf stone crabs Menippe adina, eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, red drum Sciaenops ocelatus, southern flounder Paralichthys lethostigma, and various species of commerically important shrimp (brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus azetecus, pink shrimp F. duororum, and white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus).",2008,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,47-57,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000258728300003,,,,,,"McLaughlin, K.

Despite this support the stated goals of restoration efforts are poorly defined and consequently provide no realistic measures of success in terms of time, space, or biomass. Quantitative approaches used successfully in management of and rebuilding plans for other marine and estuarine species have not been appropriately applied. Basic information in oyster population dynamics and ecology has been inadequately appreciated in defining the quantitative problem. Given these limitations it is not surprising that little success has been achieved despite the massive investment. We note a lack of ability to predict recruitment, and limit the ingress and impact of disease. Without control of both of these functions, populations cannot be managed in a self-sustaining rebuilding mode within the footprint that they either currently occupy or formerly occupied. Sustained expansion of that footprint through substrate provision is prohibitively expensive, beyond the limits set by availability of substrate material, and futile in the presence of disease and susceptible oysters. Without attaining a substantially increased and rebuilding population, ecological services will be limited. Water quality impacts will, in reality, be modest, local and seasonal, and still subject to being overwhelmed by periodic storm events. Coherent and rational evaluation of biological limitations will lead to more realistic, and indeed very modest goals for ecological restoration. We must accept the fact that efforts to date to restore native oyster populations have failed and the prognosis for improvement of this situation is continued failure. The argument is proffered that stabilizing the present bed footprint with a realistic and sustainable population and the promotion of aquaculture to increase commercial yield is a more predictable and stable economic investment.

When embryos from freshly spawned C. virginica and C. ariakensis were exposed immediately to K. veneficum at 10(4) cells mL(-1), virtually all of the developed larvae were deformed within 48 h in one experimental trial, but not in a second trial in which algae were at a different growth stage. No deformities, and mortalities of <45%, were observed in controls to which a standard diet of the haptophyte Isochrysis was added. When 2-wk-old larvae of both species were exposed to the same HAB species, the effect was a severe reduction in motility with K. veneficum, but with P. minimum only C. ariakensis was affected and not C. virginica. Comparisons were made of the frequency of these HABs in Chesapeake Bay from long-term data analysis and the temporal period of spawning. Whereas both blooms are more common during the summer months, the frequency of blooms of K. veneficum and the period of oyster spawning, June to September, coincide more strongly. To compare spatial similarity, results of a larval transport model were compared with observational data for K. veneficum. This comparison demonstrated a significant overlap in July, particularly in the northern reaches of the Bay. These eutrophication-related HABs thus have the potential to reduce survival of early life history stages of oysters and hence to reduce oyster recruitment. Any reduction in recruitment either spatially or temporally, combined with an overall reduction in sheer numbers of larvae that survive, will make restoration or establishment of significant, self-sustaining populations of natural or introduced oyster species much more difficult.",2007-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,919-925,,4,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252327300005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,VGZMD2RH,journalArticle,2007,"Barnes, T.

The greater cost of a longer grow-out phase at intermediate (10-25 ppt) salinities compensated for slightly higher mortality rates at high (>25 ppt) salinity sites, such that profitability did not vary with salinity during winter. In contrast, operations in summer always lost revenue (-28 to -37% return on investment) because of higher mortality rates at high salinities and elevated Polydora spp. infestation rates at intermediate salinities rendering the blistered oysters unsuitable for the half-shell market.

For instance, Our analyses suggest that operations with infestation rates greater than 54% Would lose revenue.

A shortage of oyster shell for creating large-scale reefs has led to widespread use of other materials such as Surf clamshell (Spisula solidissima), as a substitute for oyster shell. Oyster recruitment, survival, and growth were monitored on intertidal reefs constructed from oyster and Surf clamshell near Fisherman's Island, Virginia, U.S.A. and on a subtidal Surf clamshell reef in York River, Virginia, U.S.A. At the intertidal reefs, oyster larvae settlement occurred at similar levels on both substrate types throughout the monitoring period but higher levels of post-settlement mortality occurred on clamshell reefs. The oyster shell reef supported greater oyster growth and survival and offered the highest degree of structural complexity. On the subtidal clamshell reef, the quality of the substrate varied with reef elevation. Large shell fragments and intact valves were scattered around the reef base, whereas small, tightly packed shell fragments paved the crest and flank of the reef mound. Oysters were more abundant and larger at the base of this reef and less abundant and smaller on the reef crest.

In a soft-bottom lagoon in Virginia, we tested if recruitment differed among three reefs situated across a mainland-lagoon-barrier-island transect and among elevations (> 90-80, > 80-70, > 70-55 and > 55-20 cm below MSL) on the lagoon reef. The most abundant taxa (the invasive algae Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Codium fragile and the indigenous oyster Crassostrea virginica and algae Ulva curvata) had highest recruitment at the lagoon reef, where propagule supply was likely highest. The mainland reef had lowest algal richness (1.4-3.1 panel(-1)) and abundances (< 4% cover) compared to lagoon and island reefs (3.3-6.5 panel(-1), 14-20%), but there were no differences between sites for animals. Overall, animals and algae were equally dominant at the mainland reef, whereas algae dominated at lagoon and island reefs. High water turbidity and suspended solids are typical algal stressors at mainland reefs, and these may account for the low algal abundance in that region. For many species (at least 9 out of 14) differences in recruitment success were observed over elevation differences as small as 10-30 cm, e.g. G. vermiculophylla and C.fragile mainly recruited up to > 70-55 and > 80-70 cm respectively (probably limited upward by desiccation), U. curvata down to > 70-55 cm (probably limited downward by grazing or competition), whereas C. virginica recruited at all elevations. Animal richness was highest at the two lowest elevations (2.0-2.5 vs. 1.1-1.8 panel(-1)), but there was no effect of elevation on algae (3-6 panel(-1)) because of species substitutions between elevation levels. Thus, as in rocky intertidal systems, spatial variability in recruitment is important for community structure on oyster reefs, and if biodiversity is considered an important reef conservation goal, managers should focus conservation and restoration on locations and elevations that support successful recruitment and survival of many different species.

We then compared the effects of study site location, and habitat quality (restored versus non-restored) on macrofaunal density using thirteen response variables. Density of macrofauma was an order of magnitude higher on restored reefs, epifaunal density was more than twice as high on restored reefs and sessile macrofaunal density was two orders of magnitude higher on restored reefs. Three out of the five dominant taxonomic groups were much more abundant on restored plots.

An Asian oyster under consideration for introduction to the Chesapeake Bay, USA, the rapidly growing Suminoe oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis), may not be as successful an invader as its r-selected life history suggests if the trade-off for rapid growth and maturation is lower investment in defenses against blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) predation than the native Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). In laboratory trials, blue crabs simultaneously offered equal numbers of Suminoe and Eastern oysters consumed more nonnatives, irrespective of whether the crabs had previous experience with Suminoe oysters as prey. Satiated blue crabs consumed nearly three times as many Suminoe oysters as Eastern oysters of 25-mm shell height, and eight times as many of 35-mm shell height. Despite blue crabs consuming small (30 mm) Suminoe oysters at twice the rate of large (40 mm) Suminoe oysters, when 40-mm Suminoe were paired with 30-mm Eastern oysters, seven times as many of the larger (Suminoe) oysters were consumed. The greater susceptibility of C. ariakensis than C. virginica to blue crab predation appears to be based upon the biomechanics of shell strength rather than active selection of a more attractive food. Much less force was required to crush shells of Suminoe than Eastern oysters of similar shell height. Tissue transplant experiments demonstrated greater predation on oyster tissues in weaker C. ariakensis shells independent of tissue identity, and duration of handling time before rejection of C. virginica exceeded the time to crush C. ariakensis.. These results, coupled with the present importance of blue crab predation in limiting recovery of native Eastern oysters, imply a role for blue crabs in inhibiting Suminoe oysters, if introduced, from attaining high adult densities required to restore a fishery, provide appreciable reef habitat, and reduce turbidity through filtration. Thus, in high-predation environments, allocation of resources to rapid growth and development rather than to predation defenses reflects a life-history trade-off that may promote early stages of invasion, yet prevent attainment of dense adult populations.",2006-04,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,718-730,,2,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000237052200025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,XRTZDXA3,journalArticle,2006,"Rose, C.

However, the extent of gene flow among local populations, an important force mediating the success of these endeavors, is poorly understood. Spatial and temporal population structures were examined in C. virginica from Chesapeake Bay using eight microsatellite loci. Deficits in heterozygosity relative to Hardy-Weinberg expectations were seen at all loci and were best explained by null alleles. Permutation tests indicated that heterozygote deficiency reduced power in tests of differentiation. Nonetheless, genotypic exact tests demonstrated significant levels of geographic differentiation overall, and a subtle pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) was observed. Comparisons between age classes failed to show differences in genotype frequencies, allelic richness, gene diversity, or differentiation as measured by F-ST, contrary to predictions made by the sweepstakes hypothesis. The IBD pattern could reflect an evolutionary equilibrium established because local gene flow predominates, or be influenced in either direction by recent anthropogenic activities. An evolutionary interpretation appears justified as more parsimonious, implying that local efforts to restore oyster populations will have local demographic payoffs, perhaps at the scale of tributaries or regional subestuaries within Chesapeake Bay.",2006-03,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,158-170,,2,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000235772400009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DSCLJKNK,journalArticle,2006,"Pomeroy, Lawrence R.; D'Elia, Christopher F.; Schaffner, Linda C.",Limits to top-down control of phytoplankton by oysters in Chesapeake Bay,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,0171-8630,10.3354/meps325301,,"Restoration of the oyster Crassostrea virginica population in Chesapeake Bay is often advocated as an easy solution for controlling phytoplankton blooms. Even at their pre-colonial densities, oysters are unlikely to have controlled blooms, despite the fact that sediment cores suggest that pre-colonial spring blooms were smaller than at present. Lack of access to all bay water and low springtime filtration rates would make it impossible for oysters to control the spring bloom and the resulting summer hypoxia. Previous studies have overestimated potential oyster filtration rates, because they extrapolated summer rates to spring conditions that are 20 degrees C cooler. Previous studies have also assumed that oysters have access to all phytoplankton, without considering the spatial separation. In Chesapeake Bay, oysters and the spring bloom are separated horizontally owing to the size of the bay and its small tidal amplitude. Indeed, a multi-species guild of suspension feeders now present in the bay should have a filtration capacity approaching that of pre-colonial oysters, but it does not control the bloom. Actual oyster filtration potential must be lower than many advocates of oyster restoration assume, and replenishing the bay with oysters is not the means of controlling blooms and hypoxia.",2006,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,301-309,,,325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000242805700026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YPS4XWKS,journalArticle,2005,"Luckenbach, M.

Although programs were initially only directed at oyster fisheries augmentation, recent emphasis has shifted to include the restoration of their ecological functions. Furthermore, many of these programs are managed by environmental organizations or state agencies not traditionally involved in fisheries management or research, but rather in ecological restoration, monitoring, and/or environmental education. A simple assessment of shellfish meetings over the past five years, including the inaugural Restore America's Estuaries meeting from which this paper is derived, revealed more than 300 presentations related to oyster restoration, with fewer than 25% focused solely on oyster fishery restoration. Unfortunately, many of those efforts lacked well-defined ""success criteria,"" with progress often judged using fisheries-based metrics such as market-sized (generally 75 mm or 3"") oysters. Here we discuss our findings as they relate to the value of alternative restoration metrics and associated success criteria using data from two very different systems and approaches: one conducted in Virginia's lower Chesapeake Bay (Rappahannock River), based on data from a two-year program utilizing subtidally constructed reefs of different reef ""scale,"" and the other a long-term study in South Carolina focusing on intertidal reefs. For each system, we compared newly created reef structures, relating oyster abundance and size to resident species abundance and biodiversity over time. Our results revealed positive correlations between several community descriptors and the size and density of oysters on the reefs. Of the 15 significant (and 5 marginally insignificant) correlations observed out of a total of 78 examined across both studies, all but one were positive. The exception was for epifaunal invertebrate diversity vs. oyster biomass on the Rappahannock reefs. Despite these numerous positive correlations, none indicated that market-sized oysters are a prerequisite for supporting an abundant and diverse community. For example, intertidal oysters > 75 in. in South Carolina typically make up < 10% of all reef oysters, with a maximum of 18%. Finally, until we have a more thorough understanding of the interactions between individual species and the mechanisms linking oyster populations and reef community attributes, we propose that oyster abundance/size structure be used for assessments. Future studies need to develop and evaluate restoration progress using a combination of standardized criteria that can be applied to reef success over a wide geographical range and surrogate or indirect ecological measures (e.g., filtering, habitat use).",2005,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,64-78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000227787300006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UWUK6DYZ,journalArticle,2005,"Wall, L.

These dead margins are caused, at least in part, by boat wakes and extend significantly higher above the high water line than reefs lacking dead margins (pristine reefs). To determine if these ""impacted"" oyster reefs alter recruitment and subsequent survival of C. virginica, three 8-wk field trials were run between May 2001 and April 2002 in Mosquito Lagoon. During each trial, data were also collected on total sediment loads, silt/clay fractions and relative water motion. Although recruitment did not differ between impacted and pristine reef's, juvenile survival was significantly reduced on impacted reefs. Additionally, larval recruitment and subsequent mortality were greatest during our summer trial. Total sediment loads, percent silt/clay, and relative water motion were significantly higher on impacted reefs. For these three variables, the largest values were consistently found at the bases of exposed (seaward) regions of impacted reefs.

Trials conducted at six sites distributed across North Carolina evaluated the likely biologic success of aquaculture of C. ariakensis by assessing the oyster's growth, mortality and fouling under alternative methods and seasons of deployment. Of the six sites at which oysters were deployed, growth of C. ariakensis was greatest at the high-salinity sites, Hoop Pole Creek (29-32 ppt) and Newport River (25-30 ppt) and lowest at the low-salinity site, Nags Head (4 ppt). Across sites, growth was consistently lower (by 50%) in suspended floats than in fixed racks held 15 cm off the bottom. Only on the muddiest sediments (Newport River), where growth in tissue mass was 50% greater and growth in shell mass 20% greater on raised than bottom racks, did growth differ detectibly with rack elevation. In spite of low mortality and fouling over winter, predation in summer by blue crabs resulted in mortality approaching 50% at one of the sites (Swan Quarter) and heavy settlement by Polydora spp. produced a greater than 25% cover of mud-blisters on 84% to 97% of oysters. Consequently suitability of C. ariakensis for sale on the high-valued half-shell market may be contingent on completion of grow-out before summer Polvdora spp. infestation. Results indicate that whereas at high salinity sites grow-out from a 27-mm deployment size is typically achieved within 5 mo, at medium salinity sites > 7 mo is required. Failure to remove oysters at medium salinity sites from the water prior to summer may result in heavy Polydora spp. infestations that necessitate sale on the lower-valued shucked market.

Participants reported the frequency with which they would consume the oyster inside and outside of the existing oyster season, how they would consume the oyster and the price they might be prepared to pay for the Suminoe oyster relative to the native oyster. Because participants prepared the Suminoe oysters themselves, consumer evaluations incorporated not only attributes of the oyster meat but also the ease with which the oysters could be shucked and prepared. Consumers rated the Suminoe oyster's aroma, appearance, texture and flavor as likeable. As a result of the oyster's tissue quality and the ease with which it could be shucked, 81% indicated that they would purchase the Suminoe oyster if it is introduced. Only 19% of survey participants said they would pay more for Suminoe than Eastern oysters when both are available.

By consuming phytoplankton, suspension feeders act to suppress accumulation of organic matter in the water column. Nutrient loading increases the rate of primary production, thereby causing eutrophication. As suspension feeders consume more organic matter from increasing abundance of phytoplankton, their rate of growth should also increase if they are food limited. We show here that the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), from St. Mary's and Patuxent rivers, Chesapeake Bay, grew faster during anthropogenic eutrophication relative to C. virginica before eutrophication. Growth of shell height, shell thickness and adductor muscle increased after eutrophication began in the late 18th century. After 1860, growth decreased, perhaps reflecting the negative effects of hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, disease and fishing on oyster growth. These results are consistent with the view that an increasing supply of phytoplankton resulting from eutrophication enhanced growth of C. virginica between 1760 and 1860, before oyster reefs were degraded by destructive fishing practices between 1870 and 1930. Alternative factors, such as changes in water temperature, salinity, and fishing are less likely to be responsible for this pattern. These results have implications for restoration of oyster reefs in order to mitigate the effects of eutrophication in estuaries, as well as the paleoecological relationship between suspension feeders and paleoproductivity.

Economically, introduced oysters compose a majority of oyster harvests in many areas. Oysters are ecosystem engineers that influence many ecological processes, such as maintenance of biodiversity, population and food web dynamics, and nutrient cycling. Consequently, both their loss, through interaction of overharvest, habitat degradation, disease, poor water quality, and detrimental species interactions, and their gain, through introductions, can cause complex changes in coastal ecosystems. Introductions can greatly enhance oyster population abundance and production, as well as populations of associated native species. However, introduced oysters are also vectors for non-native species, including disease-causing organisms. Thus, substantial population, community, and habitat changes have accompanied new oysters. In contrast, ecosystem-level consequences of oyster introductions, such as impacts on flow patterns, sediment and nutrient dynamics, and native bioengineering species, are not well understood. Ecological risk assessments for future introductions must emphasize probabilities of establishment, spread, and impacts on vulnerable species, communities, and ecosystem properties.

Thus, the maintenance and restoration of oyster reefs is vital for properly functioning estuarine ecosystems. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous and refuge-rich reefs are superior habitats for oysters and associated invertebrates and fishes. If this is shown to be the case, then vertical structure and refuge should be included in the design of newly constructed oyster reefs and conserved in existing reefs. To test our hypothesis, models were built as concrete blocks into which shells were placed horizontally, vertically, and widely spaced, and vertically and closely spaced. Respectively, the units represent horizontal orientation with no refuge (HNR), vertical orientation with no refuge (VNR), and vertical orientation with refuge (VWR). Flume studies of velocity distributions over each model type showed distinctive differences that may contribute to differential settlement on the models in the absence of predators or sediment. A subsequent settlement study in the same flume showed significantly higher settlement densities to horizontal shells than to vertical shells regardless of refuge (HNR>VNR=VWR). This result indicates the primary importance of settlement surface orientation (horizontal vs. vertical) over predation refuge when predators are absent. In contrast, two field recruitment studies indicated that the importance of orientation relative to predation refuge might depend on sedimentation rates. When sedimentation was low, the number of oysters and barnacles (live, dead, and total) was significantly higher on no-refuge models than on refuge models (HNR=VNR>VWR). However, percent mortality was lower on the refuge models than on the no refuge models (HNR=VNR>VWR). This leads to a conclusion that although fewer oysters may settle on refuge shells, those that do have a higher rate of survival. In a year when sedimentation was high, recruitment and survival of oysters, barnacles, and bryozoans was higher on vertical models regardless of refuge. In aggregate, our results indicate that both vertical orientation and predation refuge are critical to the early development of the oyster reef community and should be included in restoration designs.

Because of this reduction in the areal extent of seagrass beds there has been a concomitant diminishment in dampening of water movement (waves and currents) and sediment stabilization. Due to ongoing declines in stocks of suspension-feeding eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in the same region, their feeding activity, which normally serves to improve water clarity, has been sharply reduced. We developed and parameterized a simple model to calculate how changes in the balance between sediment sources (wave-induced resuspension) and sinks (bivalve filtration, sedimentation within seagrass beds),regulate turbidity. Changes in turbidity were used to predict the light available for seagrass photosynthesis and the amount of carbon available for shoot growth. We parameterized this model using published observations and data colleted specifically for this purpose. The model predicted that when sediments were resuspended, the presence of even quite modest levels of eastern oysters (25 g dry tissue weight m(-2)) distributed uniformly throughout the modeled domain, reduced suspended sediment concentrations by nearly an order of magnitude. This increased water clarity, the depth to which seagrasses were predicted to grow. Because hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) had a much lower weight-specific filtration rate than eastern oysters; their influence on reducing turbidity was much less than oysters. Seagrasses, once established with sufficiendy high densities (>1,000 shoots m(-2)), damped waves, thereby reducing sediment resuspension and improving light conditions. This stabilizing effect was minor compared to the influence of uniformly distributed eastern oysters on water clarity. Our model predicted that restoration of eastern oysters has the potential to reduce turbidity in shallow estuaries, such as Chesapeake Bay, and facilitate ongoing efforts to restore seagrasses. This model included several simplifying assumptions, including that oysters were uniformly distributed rather than aggregated into offshore reefs and that oyster feces were not resuspended.",2004-10,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,793-806,,5,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000225305100004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CZBW86Z7,journalArticle,2004,"Bushek, D.; Richardson, D.; Bobo, M.

If pathogens remain viable in tissues attached to shell, then planting shell may inadvertently serve as a vector for pathogen transmission. Limited local shell sources may exacerbate the problem by increasing the risk of spreading novel strains into new areas if shell is derived from other regions. In South Carolina, the primary source of oyster shell is currently the Gulf of Mexico, where the protozoan oyster pathogen Perkinsus marinas (Mackin et al. 1978) has been problematic. Although P. marinus is present in South Carolina waters, different strains exist in the two regions. Given the detrimental effects of P. marinus on oysters, protocols to minimize its spread via planting of shell are needed. We conducted a short-term, replicated experiment to follow changes in P. marines abundance in oyster tissues by placing whole, intact oysters or shucked oysters in shell piles. The amount of oyster tissue present and parasite abundance declined precipitously after one month and was virtually eliminated by three months. Parasite persistence was dramatically longer in whole, unshucked oyster tissues as compared with those associated with shucked oysters. Viability of parasites after one month was, however, unclear. The results support the recommendation that the quarantine of shell for one month or more can dramatically reduce the potential risk of spreading P. marinas when planting oyster shell (=cultch) from other geographic areas. This recommendation is applicable to virtually any region, but several parameters such as effects of climatic conditions and shell pile configuration warrant further investigation as does the persistence of other pathogens on shell piles.",2004-08,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,369-373,,2,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000223925100003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DCB2ELPA,journalArticle,2004,"Milbury, C.

In 1997 the Oyster Recovery Partnership and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science planted more than four million Louisiana oysters in the Choptank River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA.

For each species, we compared density by size (age) class on oyster reefs and sedimentary bottom as a means of estimating the degree to which restoration of oyster reef on sedimentary bottom could augment abundances. By applying published information on growth rates of each species and a combination of empirical data and published information on age-specific survivorship, we calculated the per-unit-area enhancement of production of fishes and large mobile crustaceans expected from the addition of oyster reef habitat. For this calculation, we gave the reef habitat full credit for the expected lifetime production of species whose recruitment was judged to be limited by the area of oyster reefs based on nearly exclusive association of recruits to reefs. For species that were only modestly enhanced in abundance by oyster reefs, we gave the reef credit for the fraction of production that is derived from consumption of reef-associated prey, using a combination of gut content data and natural history information. This combination of analyses and calculations revealed that 10 m(2) Of restored oyster reef in the southeast United States is expected to yield an additional 2.6 kg yr(-1) of production of fish and large mobile crustaceans for the functional lifetime of the reef. Because the reef is biogenic and self-sustaining, the lifetime of a reef protected from bottom-disturbing fishing gear is limited by intense storms or sedimentation. A reef lasting 20 to 30 yr would be expected to augment fish and large mobile crustacean production by a cumulative amount of 38 to 50 kg 10 m(-2), discounted to present-day value.

The principal objectives for this work were to specify a baseline and determine trends relative to the Chesapeake Bay Program's goal to achieve a 10-fold increase in the standing stock of oysters in the Bay from a 1994 baseline. Population biomass varied by 3-fold from 1986-2001, with most of the variation caused by changes in the stock of market-sized oysters. There were also important spatial differences in population structure and trends over a gradient of salinity. Lagged correlations between small oyster biomass and either market-sized oyster biomass or landings were not statistically significant but suggested that most of the market-sized oysters and those harvested were four to five years old. The index of relative biomass for market-sized oysters proved to be a useful predictor of annual harvests in Maryland. We used this relationship to estimate absolute abundance and biomass of oysters for the time series. The latter estimates may be biased negatively with respect to true abundance and biomass because of biases in both the fishery and the fishery-independent monitoring program. The index of relative biomass will be a suitable measure of population status relative to the oyster restoration goal only so long as the population remains at relatively low levels.

In southeastern U.S. estuaries, where oyster reef development is mostly confined to the intertidal zone, eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell covered bottoms are often the only significant source of hard subtidal structure. We characterized and quantified nekton use of submerged shell rubble bottoms, and compared it to use of intertidal reefs and other subtidal bottoms in the North Inlet estuary, South Carolina. Replicate trays (0.8 m(2)) filled with shell rubble were deployed in shallow salt marsh creeks, and were retrieved after soak times of 1 to 25 days from May 1998 to March 2000. Thirty six species of fishes, representing 21 families, were identified from the 455 tray collections. Water temperature, salinity, soak time and the presence of a shell substrate all affected the catch of fishes in the trays. Catches during the warmer months were two to five times greater than those during the winter. Fishes were present in 98% of the trays with an overall average of 5.7 fish m(-2). The assemblage was numerically dominated by small resident species including naked goby (Gobiosoma bosc), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), and crested blenny (Hypleurochilus geminatus). Transient species accounted for 23% of all individuals and 62% of the total biomass due to the presence of relatively large sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and black sea bass (Centropristis striata). Both the transient and resident species displayed distinct periods of recruitment and rapid growth from April to October. Lower abundances of juvenile gobies and blennies during 1998 were attributed to long periods of depressed salinity caused by high rainfall associated with El Nino conditions in spring. Crabs and shrimps, which were often more abundant than the fishes, accounted for comparable biomass in the tray collections. In comparisons of subtidal tray and trawl catches, trays yielded 10 to 1,000 fold higher densities of some demersal fish groups. Comparisons of intertidal and subtidal gear catches indicated that many species remain in the subtidal shell bottom at all stages of the tide. This study suggests that subtidal shell bottom may be essential fish habitat for juvenile seabass, groupers, and snappers and that it may be the primary habitat for a diverse assemblage of ecologically important resident fishes and crustaceans. Given the high levels of nekton use and the areal extent of oyster shell bottoms in eastern U.S. and Gulf estuaries, increased attention to protection and restoration of these areas appears justified.",2002-10,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,1015-1024,,5,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000178996800011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TQYHPTFN,journalArticle,2001,"Lenihan, H.

We tested this hypothesis on structurally complex, species-rich biogenic reefs created by the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. We (1) sampled fishes and invertebrates on natural and restored reefs and on sand bottom to compare fish utilization of these different habitats and to characterize the trophic relations among large reef-associated fishes and benthic invertebrates, and (2) tested whether bottom-water hypoxia and fishery-caused degradation of reef habitat combine to induce mass emigration of fish that then modify community composition in refuges across an estuarine seascape. Experimentally restored oyster reefs of two heights (1 m tall ""degraded"" or 2 m tall ""natural"" reefs) were constructed at 3 and 6 m depths. We sampled hydrographic conditions within the estuary over the summer to monitor onset and duration of bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia, a disturbance resulting from density stratification and anthropogenic eutrophication. Reduction of reef height caused by oyster dredging exposed the reefs located in deep water to hypoxia/anoxia for >2 wk, killing reef-associated invertebrate prey and forcing mobile fishes into refuge habitats. Refugee fishes accumulated at high densities on reefs in oxygenated shallow water, where they depleted epibenthic crustacean prey populations. Thus, physical disturbances can impact remote, undisturbed refuge habitats through the movement and abnormal concentration of refugee organisms that have subsequent strong trophic impacts. These results have implications for the design of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), showing that reserves placed in proximity to disturbed areas may be impacted indirectly but may serve a critical refuge function on a scale that matches the mobility of consumers.",2001-06,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,764-782,,3,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169456900011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4IKM998N,journalArticle,2000,"Saoud, I.

This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic-pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived fi om oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be out focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for. a gl cater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of 'essential fish habitats' (or EFH). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We argue that these goals are. in fact, compatible and that the same strategies will promote a sustainable harvest of the resource, increased filtration of estuarine waters, and increased provision of structured habitat for finfish, crabs, and other organisms that utilize oyster reefs or receive benefit indirectly from them. Creation or designations of unharvested sites (refuge sites) are key components of these strategies. Unharvested reefs have the potential to provide vertical relief, which is typically destroyed by harvest practices, to act as a source of larvae, which potentially increases the supply of harvestable oysters, and to protect those individuals most likely to have some resistance to disease.

Remarkably, little is known about how substrate type and reef morphology affect the development of oyster populations on restored reefs. Three-dimensional, intertidal reefs were constructed near Fisherman's Island, Virginia: two reefs in 1995 using surfclam (Spisula solidissima) shell and six reefs in 1996 using surfclam shell, oyster shell, and stabilized coal ash. We have monitored oyster recruitment and growth quarterly at three tidal heights (intertidal, mean low water, and subtidal) on each reef type since their construction Oyster recruitment in 1995 exceeded that observed in the two subsequent years. High initial densities on the 1995 reefs decreased and stabilized at a mean of 418 oyster/m(2). Oyster settlement occurred on all reef types and tidal heights in 1996; however, postsettlement mortality on the surfclam shell and coal ash reefs exceeded that on the oyster shell reefs, which remained relatively constant throughout the year (mean = 935 oysters/m(2)). Field observations suggest that predation accounts for most of the observed mortality and that the clam shell and coal ash reefs, which have little interstitial space, suffer greater predation. Oyster abundance was consistently greatest higher in the intertidal zone on all reefs in each year studied. The patterns observed here lead to the preliminary conclusion that the provision of spatial refugia (both intertidal and interstitial) from predation is an essential feature of successful oyster reef restoration in this region. In addition, high levels of recruitment can provide a numerical refuge, whereby the oysters themselves will provide structure and increase the probability of an oyster population establishing successfully on the reef.",2000-06,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,387-395,,1,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088636000059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,XRBXPB5C,journalArticle,2000,"Brumbaugh, R.

A 1996 management decision to transplant large wild-caught oysters onto an oyster broodstock sanctuary reef in the Great Wicomico River, Virginia, was followed by greatly increased abundance of juvenile oysters throughout that river in 1997. Using that result as a model for strategic oyster reef restoration, citizens and school students have been enlisted to grow large numbers of hatchery-produced native oysters for restocking other sanctuary reefs throughout Chesapeake Bay.

The influence of environmental factors on faunal assemblages varies with marsh system, factor intensity or concentration, taxon studied, and with other interacting factors present.

Sediment properties (organic matter and particle size) and vegetation presence or type act on intermediate scales affecting macrofaunal abundance and composition.

Shrimps and their potential food sources were measured for delta(13)C and delta(15)N ratios between December 1995 and July 1996. During this period, shrimp length increased from 10 to 11 mm, when the animals entered Corpus Christi Bay as larvae, to 80-90 mm, when they returned to Mexico Gulf as sub-adults. Brown shrimp exhibited spatial and temporal delta(13)C variation (from -25.2 to 12.5 parts per thousand), indicating a high diversity of food sources throughout their migration. From delta(13)C values, the main sources used as food sources by juvenile brown shrimp in the Rincon Bayou marsh were Spartina alterniflora and S. spartinae detritus and benthic diatoms. delta(13)C and delta(15)N values showed that organic matter inputs carried by the river inflow can also contribute significantly to the feeding of migratory brown shrimp. In these marsh habitats, shrimp isotopic ratios changed rapidly, suggesting high tissue turnover rates. The study showed that coastal marshes after restoration through the introduction of freshwater inflow may provide feeding habitats favorable for growth and development of juvenile brown shrimp.",2000,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,205-216,,,199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088434300016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ARJ4NEAI,journalArticle,1999,"Kennedy, R.

Benthic macroinvertebrate abundance was highest on reefs spatially separated from salt marshes. Macroinvertebrate species richness was highest on reefs separated from both salt marshes and seagrass beds. Comparisons of predation on juvenile bivalves transplanted to reefs for 7-12 days indicated that survivorship of clams was greatest on reefs spatially separated from both salt marshes and seagrass beds, whereas reef proximity to vegetated habitats dirt not affect the survivorship of oysters, The foraging behavior of blue crabs may explain patterns of macroinvertebrate abundance and clam survivorship among reefs with different proximity to vegetated habitats. In experiments conducted In 30-m(2) field enclosures, blue crabs had higher predation rates on hard clams transplanted onto artificial reefs adjacent to salt marshes or seagrass beds than on reefs separated from both habitats by unvegetated sand bottom. Thus, vegetated habitats appeared to act as corridors by facilitating the access of blue crabs to oyster reefs and enhancing the intensity of blue crab predation. Such an understanding of the effects of landscape characteristics of estuarine habitats on their value as habitats for estuarine organisms can be used to predict the consequences of habitat fragmentation on ecosystem function and to improve strategies for habitat and species conservation and restoration.",1999-08,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,869-881,,4,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081771200020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,F7NZGB2W,journalArticle,1999,"Lenihan, H.

The experimental system consisted of restored subtidal oyster reefs inhabited by the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To determine whether the size of reefs influences the flow environment and oyster performance, reefs of four heights-tall (2 m), short (1 m), dredged (0.6 m), and low (0.1 m)-were constructed at 3-m water depth in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. To test whether oyster performance varies with water depth and hydrographic conditions, tall and short reefs were also constructed at 6-m water depth. Flow speed, sedimentation, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the performance of oysters were measured as a function of reef height, position on reef, and water depth over a 10-mo period. Flow speed was found to increase on reefs with reef height and elevation on reefs. Rates of sediment deposition were seasonally highest where flow speed was lowest, at the bases of reefs, and seasonally decreased with increasing water depth. More than 90% of the surface area of low reefs was buried after only 16 mo of exposure in the estuary, indicating that reef height controls habitat quality (and quantity) indirectly through its effect on flow. Short reefs and the bases of tall reefs at 6-m depth were exposed to a total of 26 d of hypoxia/anoxia. No other reef treatment was exposed to >5 d of hypoxia. Physical conditions on experimental reefs had a profound influence on the performance of oysters as the flow environment alone explained 81% of variability in oyster growth and mortality. Recruitment of oysters over a 2-mo period was slightly higher on the front bases than the crests of reefs, but did not vary with reef height or water depth. After 10 mo, the shell growth and condition index of genetically similar, hatchery-raised oysters were greatest on the crests of tall and short reefs, where flow speed and quality of suspended food material were highest, and sediment deposition was lowest. Growth was greatest overall at the crests of tall reefs located at 6-m water depth where flow speed was high, and the numbers of days exposed to hypoxia/anoxia and variation in salinity were lowest. Total percentage mortality of oysters after 10 mo was greater on low reefs located at 3-m depth than on all other reef types and was greater on the bases than crests of tall, short, and dredged reefs. Predation by crabs and fishes accounted for 4-20% of total oyster mortality and showed no pattern across reef treatments. Results of this experiment indicate (1) that the physical structure and location of biogenic habitat controls local physical variables and (2) that, in turn, physical variables, especially flow speed, have a profound influence on the performance of a resident species. Realization that an ecological function of habitat is to indirectly control local population production through physical-biological coupling should improve our ability to conserve, restore, and manage habitat and associated species diversity. Better ecological engineering of restored oyster reef habitat is likely to improve fishery production and help maintain estuarine biodiversity.",1999-08,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,251-275,,3,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081746100001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q4WTTC6M,journalArticle,1998,"Southworth, M.; Mann, R.","Oyster reef broodstock enhancement in the Great Wicomico River, Virginia",Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,,,"The Great Wicomico River is a small, trap-type estuary on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay that once supported substantial oyster populations. These populations were essentially eliminated by the combined effects of Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972, and subsequent disease mortalities related to Perkinsus marinus and Haplosporidium nelsoni. Oyster broodstock enhancement was initiated in June 1996 by the construction of a three-dimensional intertidal reef with oyster shell, followed by the ""seeding,"" in December 1996, of that reef with high densities of large oysters from disease-challenged populations in Pocomoke and Tangier Sound. Calculations of estimated fecundity of the reef population suggest that oyster egg production from this source is within an order of magnitude of total egg production in the Great Wicomico River prior to Tropical Storm Agnes. Field studies in 1997 indicate spawning by reef oysters from July through September. P. marinus prevalence increased from 32% in June to 100% in July, whereas intensity increased from June to September; H. nelsoni was absent. Plankton rows recorded oyster larval concentrations as high of 37,362 +/- 4,380 m(-3) on June 23. Such values are orders of magnitude higher than those typically recorded in Virginia subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay in the past three decades, and lend support to a premise that aggregating large oysters may increase fertilization efficiency. Drifter studies suggest strong local retention of larvae, a suggestion reinforced by marked increases in local oyster spatfall on both shellstring collectors and bottom substrate compared with years prior to 1997. In locations where local circulation promotes larval retention, the combination of reef construction with broodstock enhancement may provide an accelerated method for oyster population restoration.",1998-12,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,1101-1114,,4,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000079628200025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D9J5J7D2,journalArticle,1998,"Melancon, E.; Soniat, T.; Cheramie, V.; Dugas, R.; Barras, J.; Lagarde, M.",Oyster resource zones of the Barataria and Terrebonne estuaries of Louisiana,Journal of Shellfish Research,,0730-8000,,,"A 1:100,000 scale map delineating the subtidal oyster resource zones within the Barataria and Terrebonne estuaries was developed. Strategies to accomplish the task included interviews with Louisiana oystermen and stare biologists to develop a draft map, field sampling to document oyster (Crassostrea virginica), Dermo (Perkinsus marinus), and oyster drill (Stramonita haemastoma) abundances, use of historical salinity data to aid in map verification, and public meetings to allow comment on a draft before final map preparation. Four oyster resource zones were delineated on the final map: a dry zone where subtidal oysters may be found when salinities increase, a wet zone where subtidal oysters may be found when salinities are suppressed, a wet-dry zone where subtidal oysters may be consistently found due to favorable salinities, and a high-salinity zone where natural oyster populations are predominantly found in intertidal and shallow waters. The dry zone is largely coincident with the brackish-marsh habitat, with some intermediate-type marsh. The wet-dry zone is found at the interface of the brackish and saline marshes, but extends further seaward than up-estuary. The wet zone and the high salinity zones are areas of mostly open water fringed by salt marshes. The dry zone encompasses 91,775 hectares, of which 48,788 hectares are water (53%). The wet zone encompasses 83,525 hectares, of which 66,958 hectares are water (80%). The wet-dry zone encompasses 171,893 hectares, of which 104,733 hectares are water (61%). The high salinity zone encompasses 125,705 hectares, of which 113,369 hectares are water (90%). There is a clear trend of increasing water habitat in the four zones over the past 30 years, and oysters are now cultivated on bottoms that were once marsh.

To explain oyster loss, we tested whether (1) mortality of oysters on natural oyster reefs varies with water depth (3 m vs. 6 m), (2) harvesting by oyster dredges reduces the height of oyster reefs, and (3) bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia and reduction in reef height through fishery disturbance interact to enhance mortality of oysters in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. The percentage of oysters found dead (mean +/- 1 SD) during a survey of natural reefs in May 1993 was significantly greater at 6-m (92 +/- 10%) than at 3-m (28 +/- 9%) water depth. Less than one season's worth of oyster dredging reduced the height of restored oyster reefs by similar to 30%. During stratification of the water column in summer, oxygen depletion near the seafloor at 6 m caused mass mortality of oysters, other invertebrates, and fishes on short, deep experimental reefs, while oysters and other reef associates elevated into the surface layer by sufficient reef height or by location in shallow water survived. Highly mobile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) abandoned burrows located in hypoxic/anoxic bottom waters but remained alive in shallow water, Our results indicate that interaction of reef habitat degradation (height reduction) through fishery disturbance and extended bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia caused the pattern of oyster mortality observed on natural reefs and influences the abundance and distribution of fish and invertebrate species that utilize this temperate reef habitat.

In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of changes in salinity on protein synthesis of oyster hemocytes. Increasing salinity from a control value of 20-25 ppt to 32-98 ppt decreased the rate of incorporation of amino acid into protein, but did not qualitatively alter the pattern of protein synthesis. On the other hand, decreasing salinity to 3.5-4 ppt not only decreased the rate of protein synthesis, but also altered the types of protein produced. At least a third of the cells remained Viable at low salinity and resumed the control pattern of protein synthesis within hours after return to the normal medium. The response to hypoosmotic shock was different from the response to a hyperthermic shock, each stressor inducing expression of a characteristic set of proteins. Preferential synthesis of these proteins may represent an adaptation to preserve or restore oyster cell functions under adverse conditions.

One obstacle in the efforts to ''save the bay'' has been continuing nutrient enrichment from agricultural and sewer runoff. The attainability of a mandated 40% nutrient reduction goal has yet to be seen. Furthermore, disappearance of certain organisms may have had an adverse effect on the resilience of the ecosystem. The Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), once abundant in Chesapeake Bay, was a vital part of the food web, processing excess phytoplankton and depositing materials on the bottom. Over harvesting and disease have decimated the native oyster population. The introduction of an exotic species, the Japanese oyster (Crassostrea gigas), may be a way to reestablish a robust oyster community in the bay. The literature on the role of bivalve molluscs in estuarine ecosystems shows: that they are an essential part of healthy estuaries around the world. A comparison of C. virginica and C. gigas in terms of temperature and salinity tolerance and resistance to disease shows that C. virginica is ideally adapted to conditions in Chesapeake Bay, but it is unable to stave off the endemic diseases, whereas C. gigas is adapted to conditions in the lower bay only but is much less susceptible to the same diseases. We conclude that the potential introduction of C. gigas to Chesapeake Bay would be limited by the Japanese species' physiological requirements but that the revitalization of a bivalve population is imperative to the restoration of ecosystem function.",1996-09,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,639-650,,3,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VP80600012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GFC2HRZI,journalArticle,1992,"ULANOWICZ, RE; TUTTLE, JH",THE TROPHIC CONSEQUENCES OF OYSTER STOCK REHABILITATION IN CHESAPEAKE BAY,Estuaries,,0160-8347,10.2307/1352778,,"There is mounting speculation that overharvesting of oyster stocks (Crassostrea virginica) in Chesapeake Bay may be a factor contributing to the decline in water quality and shifts in the dominance of species inhabiting the estuary. The trophic consequences of increasing the oyster population may be addressed using a simple quasi-equilibrium, mass action model of the exchanges transpiring in the Chesapeake mesohaline ecosystem. According to output from the model, increasing oyster abundance would decrease phytoplankton productivity as well as stocks of pelagic microbes, ctenophores, medusae, and particulate organic carbon. Recently acquired field data on phytoplankton productivity, bacterioplankton, and labile organic carbon in the vicinity of rafted oyster aquaculture support model predictions. The model also indicates that more oysters should increase benthic primary production, fish stocks, and mesozooplankton densities. Hence, augmenting the oyster community by restoring beds or introducing raft culture represents a potentially significant adjunct to the goal of mitigating eutrophication through curtailment of nutrient inputs.",1992-09,3/25/19 20:55,3/25/19 20:55,,298-306,,3,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JM79400005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
