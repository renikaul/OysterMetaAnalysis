We developed stage-based population models for each region of the CRC in AD Model Builder using dredge survey and harvest data provided by Maryland Department of Natural Resources from 1989 to 2015. Patterns in exploitation rates over time varied among regions. Abundance generally decreased during 1989-2003 and increased thereafter. Recruitment was greatest in the late 1990s, 2010, and 2012, which led to increases in abundance. Natural mortality was low across all regions during 2004-2015.

These efforts are widely constrained by the availability, cost, and suitability of substrates to support oyster settlement and reef establishment. In particular, oyster shell is often the preferred substrate but is relatively scarce and increasingly expensive. Thus, there is a need for alternative oyster restoration materials that are cost-effective, abundant, and durable. Methods: We tested the viability of two low-cost substrates-concrete and recycled blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) traps-in facilitating oyster recovery in a replicated 22-month field experiment at historically productive but now degraded intertidal oyster grounds on northwestern Florida's Nature Coast. Throughout the trial, we monitored areal oyster cover on each substrate; at the end of the trial, we measured the densities of oysters by size class (spat, juvenile, and market-size) and the biomass and volume of each reef. Results: Oysters colonized the concrete structures more quickly than the crab traps, as evidenced by significantly higher oyster cover during the first year of the experiment. By the end of the experiment, the concrete structures hosted higher densities of spat and juveniles, while the density of market-size oysters was relatively low and similar between treatments. The open structure of the crab traps led to the development of larger-volume reefs, while oyster biomass per unit area was similar between treatments. In addition, substrates positioned at lower elevations (relative to mean sea level) supported higher oyster abundance, size, and biomass than those less frequently inundated at higher elevations. Discussion: Together, these findings indicate that both concrete and crab traps are viable substrates for oyster reef restoration, especially when placed at lower intertidal elevations conducive to oyster settlement and reef development.","2/25/19","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e6488",NA,"","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000459588900008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, 'Metapopulation Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical(e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the 'Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for 'Metapopulation Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., ""win-win"" locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., ""tradeoff"" locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits.","1/25/19","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0210936",NA,"1","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457037500075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Overharvesting, destructive fishing practices, and environmental degradation have caused significant declines in global oyster populations, necessitating restoration efforts in many regions to rebuild oyster habitat and recover lost services. Understanding how biological and physical gradients regulate oyster recruitment, survivorship and growth will help guide future efforts to successfully restore oyster populations. We conducted a field experiment in Ipswich, Massachusetts, to quantify the effects of tidal elevation, predator exclusion, and reef vertical relief on oyster settlement, recruitment and survivorship. Oyster settlement was 3 times greater at the deepest intertidal elevation compared to the 2 shallower intertidal elevations. Reef vertical relief and predator exclusion did not affect oyster settlement or survivorship. Despite increased sedimentation and algal fouling with increasing depth, living oyster densities remained significantly elevated at the deepest intertidal elevation 8 mo after the experimental reefs were constructed. Oyster mortality during this period was highest (>70%) at our shallowest elevation treatment, likely the result of desiccation and food limitation. Meanwhile, mortality during the first winter post-recruitment was high across all elevations (all >64 %), with our deepest elevation treatment experiencing the highest mortality rate (90%). Our results suggest that there is a gradient in oyster settlement rates, which increase at lower elevation, and that the dominant drivers of mortality also likely vary with elevation. Our findings highlight the need for region-specific studies to quantify biological and physical gradients prior to large-scale restoration efforts.","1/17/19","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"119-132",NA,"","609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000456207300008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although oyster reefs in the Bay occur in both tidal zones, subtidal reefs have received the most attention because they support most of the oyster fishery. The present study provides new information on the distribution, condition, and ecology of the intertidal reefs, and assessed the general utility of high-resolution satellite imagery for routine monitoring of the extent and condition of intertidal oysters. Using online, freely available color imagery and manual interpretation, a total of 782 individual reefs ranging in size from similar to 3 m(2) to 3.9 ha (= 9.7 acres) and covering a total of 94 ha (233 ac) of bottom area were mapped. Field inspection and sampling of 100 individual intertidal reefs on November 12-16. 2016, confirmed wide differences in the number and areal coverage of reefs in the three major geographic regions in the Bay: 433 reefs covering a total of 56 ha (139 acres) in the western area (St. Vincent Sound); 113 reefs covering 8 ha (19 acres) in the central area; and 236 reefs covering 30 ha (75 acres) in the eastern area (St. George Sound). Most reefs in the western portion of the bay consisted of recently dead (""box"") oysters in all size classes, suggesting a recent massive mortality event. Mean densities (all size classes combined) of live oysters in the central and eastern areas were 42.9/m(2) (+/- 7.39; 1 SE) and 99.3/m(2) (+/- 13.22; 1 SE), respectively, with an overall mean shell height of 23.6 nun. Size-frequency histograms indicated only two year classes of live oysters, and the largest oyster collected was 84 mm. Although detailed quantitative comparisons with subtidal reefs were not possible, data from the present study suggest that intertidal reefs cover much less bottom area of the bay, but may contain much higher live oyster densities. The present study also demonstrated the use of high-resolution satellite imagery for mapping reefs as small as a few square meters in surface area, and the potential for estimating relative reef condition measured by live oyster density.","2018-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1027-1038",NA,"5","37",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454313900014",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the capacity of diverse mid-Atlantic bivalves to filter particles and potentially enhance water clarity and quality. Species with the greatest clearance rates and population carrying capacity were also considered for their restoration and enhancement potential. Compared with eastern oysters, several additional species of saltwater bivalves and freshwater mussels are reported to filter water at rates that merit restoration attention and have been shown to attain significant population sizes. More work is needed to estimate system-carrying capacity and to eliminate restoration bottlenecks for some species-all bivalve species have constraints on their distribution and abundance.

Oyster reefs provide habitat and refuge for organisms, improve water quality, and decrease erosion. Oyster restoration projects aim to construct reefs that function similarly to their natural counterparts. Therefore, post-creation monitoring of these reefs is crucial in determining restoration success. However, monitoring is often lacking or focused only on oyster density and size rather than ecosystem functions such as nekton utilization. This study examines nekton utilization among created reefs compared to natural reefs in an estuary in Wilmington, North Carolina. The objective was to determine whether the created reefs function similarly to the natural reefs in abundance, species richness, and fish size. Using seine nets and Breder traps, reefs were sampled over a 5-month period. No significant difference was detected among reefs for nekton abundance, species richness, and standard length. This is a promising result for future management, indicating that created and natural reefs can support similar communities of fishes and shrimp.","2018-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"2426-2432",NA,"8","41",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000448508400020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster restoration, in particular, faces threats from alterations in precipitation, warming water temperatures, and urbanization of coastlines that dramatically change salinity patterns, foster the proliferation and spread disease, and disrupt habitat connectivity, respectively. New York City (NYC) coastal waters, once home to a booming oyster fishery for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), are now nearly devoid of live oyster reefs. Oyster restoration in urban estuaries is motivated by the synergistic ecosystem benefits this native keystone species can deliver. Recent surveys have documented substantial remnant populations of adult oysters in the upper low salinity zone of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary (HRE) near Tarrytown, NY. This study assessed fitness-related performance across the HRE salinity gradient to evaluate habitat suitability on an estuarine scale. Oysters were hatchery-produced from wild, moderate-salinity broodstock, then outplanted for measurement of growth, survival, reproduction and disease prevalence over two years. Survival was generally higher in the lower salinity river sites and in the higher salinity Jamaica Bay sites relative to mesohaline NYC harbor sites. Growth rate was highest in Jamaica Bay and had high variation among other sites. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of individuals with sex-differentiated gametes and the highest average gonad maturation index was found at a low salinity site. Consistent with the advanced gametogenesis measured in experimental animals at low salinity, annual wild recruitment was documented near the low salinity remnant population in each of five monitored years. These results suggest that the remnant HRE oyster population is a robust, self-sustaining population that can be leveraged to support restoration of subpopulations in other parts of the estuary, but further research is required to determine if the mesohaline and near-ocean reaches of the HRE can support the full oyster life cycle.","11/16/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0207368",NA,"11","13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000450420900029",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study characterized spatial effects of whole-reef (oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and other filter feeders on the reef) filtration in the water immediately above and adjacent to a small ( similar to 300 m(2)) intertidal reef in Tarpon Bay, Sanibel, Florida. Changes in water column parameters were measured in 2010 (chlorophyll a only) and 2013 (chlorophyll a and turbidity) by slowly paddling a kayak back-and-forth across the reef while logging position and water data. Although oysters were the dominant filter feeder, mussels, slipper shells, sponges, and a filter-feeding crab also occurred on the reef. Ambient water flow speed and direction were concurrently determined in 2013 by an acoustic-doppler current profiler. Measurements were made on two days (1-2 June) in 2010, and two days (November 15 and December 9) in 2013. ArcGIS software was used to plot the data and construct two-dimensional maps showing changes in chlorophyll a and turbidity, which clearly indicated the spatial extent of decreases in both as water flowed across the reef. Seston decrease (interpreted as depletion) levels were spatially variable, averaging 23-25% but as high as 68% in some areas directly over the reef. The extent of detectable depletion usually extended 10-20 m beyond the edge of the reef, potentially increasing light levels and thereby providing enhanced growth conditions for adjacent seagrasses and algae, suggesting that restoration success of macrophyte habitats could be enhanced by close spatial coupling with oyster reef restoration.","11/15/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"265-272",NA,"","212",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446286100026",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A century of habitat degradation has resulted in substantial reductions in the extent and quality of oyster reefs in many estuaries, thus spurring restoration efforts.

Oysters and resident and transient fishes and crustaceans were monitored at the restored reef as well as at nearby natural oyster reef and unrestored bottom (i.e., dense mud with shell hash) habitats for two years following reef construction. The restored reef had substantial oyster recruitment and growth, with oyster abundance and size comparable to nearby habitats within the first year. Resident and transient fauna communities recruited to the restored reef within six months post-construction, and abundance and diversity were comparable to nearby habitats. Significant changes observed in oyster densities between the first and second year post-restoration demonstrate the importance of monitoring over multiple years to capture multiple recruitment cycles and growth to market size. Nekton densities did not change significantly after the first year, but changes in community assemblages were observed through the end of the study. The high densities of oysters and resident nekton relative to other studies indicate that this restoration project was successful in restoring suitable habitat. The design of the reef complex, consisting of relatively high-relief reef mounds and deeper corridors, likely contributed to the relatively high oyster and nekton densities observed in this study.

Despite considerable investment, it is unclear how the scale of and approaches toward oyster restoration have evolved. A synthesis of 1768 projects undertaken since 1964 reveals that oyster substrate restoration efforts have primarily been concentrated in the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf Coast, have been heavily reliant on oyster shell, and have re-established 4.5% of the reef area that has been lost across all regions. By comparing costs to ecosystem service benefits, we discovered that the return-on-investment of oyster restoration varies widely, but generally increases with project size. To facilitate the recovery of coastal ecosystems and their services, scientists and resource managers must adopt a new restoration paradigm prioritizing investment in sites that maximize economic and ecological benefits and minimize construction costs.","2018-10","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"463-470",NA,"8","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446011400009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Globally, however, oysters have precipitously declined in numbers over the last century. To remedy this drastic decrease, many coastal areas have initiated oyster restoration projects. In the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) of Florida, where oyster loss was primarily the result of recreational boat wake dislodgment, researchers have put in place a unique method to supplement natural recruitment of oysters. This method consists of deploying stabilized shell attached to mesh mats. Larval oysters thus have substrate on which to settle and three-dimensional reef habitats have been reestablished in historical footprints. This restoration project has proven to be successful, shown by 9 years of data collection on growth, recruitment, and survivability. In this study, we sought to determine the length of time required for newly restored oyster reefs to reach equivalent levels of genetic diversity as undisturbed, natural (reference) oyster reefs. Additionally, we determined if recreational harvesting impacted the genetic diversity of these reference reefs. Using nine microsatellite loci, we found that restored oyster reefs accumulated as much genetic diversity as natural reefs as quickly as 1 month after stabilized shells were deployed. We likewise found that harvesting did not impact genetic diversity in oyster reefs in the IRL. These results are encouraging, and are a valuable addition to understanding the importance of oyster reef restoration on the ecosystem.","2018-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"943-951",NA,"5","26",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000443586200017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is well established that habitat restoration results in higher finfish biomass and diversity where oyster reefs replace bare substrata. Therefore, restoring oyster reefs with a view to also improving fish stocks is often a key goal of oyster restoration. However, the principles of habitat quality, ecological connectivity and broader ecosystem management are poorly integrated within oyster reef restoration ecology, but such principles may be instructive in enhancing the benefits of projects on fish populations throughout estuarine seascapes. This manuscript presents a framework for projects seeking to restore both oyster reef habitat and finfish communities. Structurally and biologically complex oyster reefs, comprising both oysters and other invertebrates, are required to provide shelter, food and nursery services to fish. By carefully considering site selection at seascape scales (km to 10s of km), restoration can enhance the network of habitat available to fish and potentially increase the overall carrying capacity of the estuary. Managers of estuaries that now include restored oyster reefs should implement fisheries management plans and consider the effects of management actions broadly throughout catchments; failing to do so may jeopardize gains in fish yields. Management decisions must be adaptable, responding to key criteria in thorough monitoring programs. Integrating these ecological and coastal management concepts into oyster reef restoration will enhance outcomes for fishes and increase stakeholder engagement and cost-effectiveness.","2018-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"931-947",NA,"5","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000443114900013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster populations have declined dramatically due to overharvesting, habitat loss, and disease. As restoration efforts and aquaculture of oysters continue to increase throughout their range, it is important to consider the impacts of a number of potential oyster pests, including the boring sponge Cliona spp. and the pea crab Zaops (Pinnotheres) ostreum, on oyster populations. Both of these have been demonstrated to reduce oyster growth, condition, and in some instances, reproductive output. Boring sponges in particular are a major concern for oyster growers and managers. Our monitoring efforts have suggested that pea crabs might be more prevalent in sponge-infested oysters; we therefore conducted an observational study to determine if there was any relationship between pea crab prevalence and sponge presence, and to examine whether the presence of both pests had synergistic effects on oyster condition. At 2 very different sample sites, North Carolina and New Jersey, oysters with 1 pest (i.e. boring sponge) were significantly more likely to have the second pest (i.e. pea crab) than the background population. Furthermore, sponge presence negatively affected oyster condition in North Carolina only, while pea crabs significantly reduced condition at both locations. When sponges and pea crabs were present together, the effects on oyster condition were additive. This study provides further evidence that interactions between an individual and a fouling/pest organism can alter oyster susceptibility to other parasites.","8/28/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"25-36",NA,"1","130",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446368500003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster densities of the 3 reefs were 350, 295, and 186 oysters m(-2). Mean summer values of nighttime oxygen flux (FluxDARK) were -488,-428,-300, and-56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) over the natural reef, 2 restoration reefs, and mudflat, respectively. All 4 sites had smaller daytime vs. nighttime oxygen uptake, with mean summer differences between FluxDARK and FluxLIGHT of 360, 250, 239, and 27 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Light was an important short-term driver of daytime reef oxygen flux due to its effect on microalgal photosynthesis. All 3 oyster reefs were significantly heterotrophic, with summer net ecosystem metabolism values ranging from -157 to -298 mmol m(-2) d(-1). FluxDARK values were similar across the 3 reefs when normalized by density, with values between -1.8 and -2.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) oyster(-1). This study represents the most detailed measurements to date of in situ oyster reef oxygen flux, and shows that benthic microalgae can significantly impact reef oxygen dynamics. FluxDARK values scale with oyster density, and consequently can be used as a metric for reef restoration success.","7/12/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"75-91",NA,"","599",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000440371600006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The existence of this threshold, which can often be a complex, multi-dimensional surface, rather than a single point, is of particular importance in degraded populations for which there is a desire for successful restoration. Here, we incorporated positive density dependence into a closed, size- and age-structured integral projection model parameterized with empirical data from an eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, population in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. To understand the properties of the threshold surface, and implications for restoration, we introduced a general method based on a linearization of the threshold surface at its unique, unstable equilibrium. We estimated the number of oysters of a particular age (i.e., stock enhancement), or the surface area of dead shell substrate required (i.e., habitat enhancement) to move a population from an extinction trajectory to a persistence trajectory. The location of the threshold surface was strongly affected by changes in the amount of local larval retention. Traditional stock enhancement with oysters <1 yr old (i.e., spat) required three times as many oysters relative to stock enhancement with oysters between ages 3 and 7yr old, while the success of habitat enhancement depended upon the initial size distribution of the population. The methodology described here demonstrates the importance of considering positive density dependence in oyster populations, and also provides insights into effective management and restoration strategies when dealing with a high dimensional threshold separating extinction and persistence.","2018-06","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"897-909",NA,"4","28",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000434092200004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to the complex structure of subtidal oyster reefs, one effective and efficient means to sample is by patent tongs, rather than SCUBA, dredges, or bottom cores. Restored reefs vary in relief and oyster density, either of which could affect survey efficiency. This study is the first to evaluate gear (the first full grab) and survey (which includes selecting a specific half portion of the first grab for further processing) efficiencies of hand-operated patent tongs as a function of reef height and oyster density on subtidal restoration reefs. In the Great Wicomico River, a tributary of lower Chesapeake Bay, restored reefs of high-and low-relief (25 +/- 45 cm, and 8 +/- 12 cm, respectively) were constructed throughout the river as the first large-scale oyster sanctuary reef restoration effort (sanctuary acreage > 20 ha at one site) in Chesapeake Bay. We designed a metal frame to guide a non-hydraulic mechanical patent tong repeatedly into the same plot on a restored reef until all oysters within the grab area were captured. Full capture was verified by an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. Samples (n = 19) were taken on nine different reefs, including five low-(n = 8) and four high-relief reefs (n = 11), over a two-year period. The gear efficiency of the patent tong was estimated to be 76% (+/- 5% standard error), whereas survey efficiency increased to 81% (+/- 10%) due to processing. Neither efficiency differed significantly between young-of-the-year oysters (spat) and adults, high-and low-relief reefs, or years. As this type of patent tong is a common and cost-effective tool to evaluate oyster restoration projects as well as population density on fished habitat, knowing the gear and survey efficiencies allows for accurate and precise population estimates.","5/2/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0196725",NA,"5","13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000431281900074",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Successful restoration is a byproduct of several factors, including physical and biological processes, as well as permitting and logistical considerations. Rarely are factors from all of these categories included in HSI models, despite their combined relevance to common restoration goals such as population persistence. We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based HSI for restoring persistent high-relief subtidal oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs protected from harvest (i.e., sanctuaries) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. Expert stakeholder input identified 17 factors to include in the HSI. Factors primarily represented physical (e.g., salinity) and biological (e.g., larval dispersal) processes relevant to oyster restoration, but also included several relevant permitting (e.g., presence of seagrasses) and logistical (e.g., distance to restoration material stockpile sites) considerations. We validated the model with multiple years of oyster density data from existing sanctuaries, and compared HSI output with distributions of oyster reefs from the late 1800's. Of the 17 factors included in the model, stakeholders identified four factors-salinity, larval export from existing oyster sanctuaries, larval import to existing sanctuaries, and dissolved oxygen-most critical to oyster sanctuary site selection. The HSI model provided a quantitative scale over which a vast water body (similar to 6,000 km(2)) was narrowed down by 95% to a much smaller suite of optimal (top 1% HSI) and suitable (top 5% HSI) locations for oyster restoration. Optimal and suitable restoration locations were clustered in northeast and southwest Pamlico Sound. Oyster density in existing sanctuaries, normalized for time since reef restoration, was a positive exponential function of HSI, providing validation for the model. Only a small portion (10-20%) of historical reef locations overlapped with current, model-predicted optimal and suitable restoration habitat. We contend that stronger linkages between larval connectivity, landscape ecology, stakeholder engagement and spatial planning within HSI models can provide a more holistic, unified approach to restoration.","4/4/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"UNSP 76",NA,"","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457075000001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we characterize the boat wake climate in the Intracoastal Waterway, assess the bathymetry in this heavily trafficked area, and anticipate the effects of experimental living shorelines (natural breakwall and oyster restoration structures) on facilitating sediment deposition and slowing vegetation retreat. Field observations indicate that boat wakes suspend nearshore sediment and can reach heights greater than 40 cm. A numerical stability model of the breakwalls suggests that the optimal porosity is field-specific. The desired porosity for minimizing lateral displacement is 0.50, while it is 0.18 for maximum energy dissipation, which indicates a need to further investigate this complex problem.

By studying Pleistocene fossil oyster assemblages, it is possible to reconstruct baseline conditions and develop recommendations for oyster mitigation. Fossil assemblages were studied from five Pleistocene sites located in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Reconstructions of paleosalinity and temperature were used to identify modern and colonial sites with similar environmental parameters for comparison. Shell height and life span in Chesapeake Bay oysters declined significantly from the Pleistocene to today, at the same time that ontogenetic growth rates have increased. This pattern is driven by age truncation, in which both harvesting and disease preferentially remove the larger, reproductively more active and primarily female members of the population. By contrast, Pleistocene oysters from North Carolina did not differ significantly, in shell height, life span, or growth rates, from modern oysters. Although oyster management in the Mid-Atlantic States has focused historically on protecting and supplementing early life stages, this study recommends three potential management solutions to the age truncation revealed by comparison with Pleistocene oysters.

However, by processing nutrients and organic material from the water column, the culture of many suspension-feeding bivalves has been proposed as a novel solution toward mitigating problems facing coastal water quality, including the removal of disease-causing parasites. Here we developed and simulated an epidemiological model describing sympatric oyster Crassostrea virginica populations in aquaculture and the wild impacted by the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus. Our model captured the indirect interaction between wild and cultured populations that occurs through sharing water-borne P. marinus transmission stages, and we hypothesized that oyster aquaculture can enhance wild oyster populations through reduced parasitism as long as cultured oysters are harvested prior to spreading disease. We found that the density of oysters in aquaculture, which is commonly thought to lead to the spread of disease through farms and out to nearby populations in the wild, has only indirect effects on P. marinus transmission through its interaction with the rate of aquaculture harvests. Sufficient aquaculture harvest, which varies with the susceptibility of farmed oysters to P. marinus infection and their lifespan once infected, reduces disease by diluting parasites in the environment. Our modeling results offer new insights toward the broader epidemiological implications of oyster aquaculture and effective disease management.","2018","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"557-567",NA,"","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454301700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bivalves impact nutrient cycling, create and modify habitat, and affect food webs directly (i.e., prey) and indirectly (i.e., movement of nutrients and energy).

Water column chlorophyll a concentrations and crab behavior were measured over the duration of the experiment. Predation risk had no effect on oyster reef drawdown of chlorophyll a, which suggests that this important ecosystem function of oyster reefs is not mediated by behaviorally induced predator effects.

The results demonstrate that the optimal combination of temperature and salinity where Louisiana oysters experience reduced mortality and fast growth rates is skewed toward lower salinities and higher water temperatures than previous models have suggested. Outside of that optimal range, oysters are commonly exposed to combinations of temperature and salinity that are correlated with highmortality and reduced growth. How these combinations affect growth, and to a lesser degree mortality, appears to be size class dependent.

Intertidal habitats must maintain their surface elevations with respect to sea level to persist via vertical growth or landward retreat, but projected rates of sea-level rise may exceed the accretion rates of many biogenic habitats. While considerable attention is focused on climate change over centennial timescales, relative sea level also fluctuates dramatically (10-30cm) over month-to-year timescales due to interacting oceanic and atmospheric processes. To assess the response of oyster-reef (Crassostrea virginica) growth to interannual variations in mean sea level (MSL) and improve long-term forecasts of reef response to rising seas, we monitored the morphology of constructed and natural intertidal reefs over 5years using terrestrial lidar. Timing of reef scans created distinct periods of high and low relative water level for decade-old reefs (n=3) constructed in 1997 and 2000, young reefs (n=11) constructed in 2011 and one natural reef (approximately 100years old). Changes in surface elevation were related to MSL trends. Decade-old reefs achieved 2cm/year growth, which occurred along higher elevations when MSL increased. Young reefs experienced peak growth (6.7cm/year) at a lower elevation that coincided with a drop in MSL. The natural reef exhibited considerable loss during the low MSL of the first time step but grew substantially during higher MSL through the second time step, with growth peaking (4.3cm/year) at MSL, reoccupying the elevations previously lost. Oyster reefs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium with short-term (month-to-year) fluctuations in sea level, evidencing notable resilience to future changes to sea level that surpasses other coastal biogenic habitat types. These growth patterns support the presence of a previously defined optimal growth zone that shifts correspondingly with changes in MSL, which can help guide oyster-reef conservation and restoration.","2017-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"10409-10420",NA,"23","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000417754100045",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reefs higher than 0.3 m supported greater oyster density, survival, and reef complexity, whereas sediment deposition was reduced. Reefs lower than 0.3 m experienced heavy sediment deposition and were eventually buried.

If antibiotics impact fish as they do mice and humans, prophylactic administrations on aquaculture farms may increase downstream disease susceptibility in target hosts, despite short-term pathogen control benefits. We tested the effects of antibiotics on mortality after a pathogen challenge in the Poecilia sphenops black molly and subsequently tested if probiotic inoculations could reverse any antibiotic-induced losses of disease resistance. We found that antibiotic treatment significantly increased fish mortality. We further found that our two candidate probiotic bacterial species, Phaeobacter inhibens S4Sm and Bacillus pumilus RI06-95Sm, were able to colonize black molly microbiomes and reverse the negative impacts of antibiotics. Despite the positive impact on survival, probiotic treatment did not influence overall microbiome community structure or diversity. Our results suggest that subtle manipulations of microbiome composition can have dramatic impacts on host phenotype. The results of this study have implications for how antibiotic-treated microbiomes can be restored and suggest that small-scale additions may be as effective as wholesale transplants.

If antibiotics impact fish as they do mice and humans, prophylactic administrations in aquaculture and ornamental fish farms may increase downstream disease susceptibility in target hosts, despite short-term pathogen control benefits. Recent research has suggested that their use exacerbates bacterial outbreaks by creating sterile, nutrient-rich environments for invading pathogens to colonize and could help to explain rising economic costs of bacterial outbreaks in aquaculture.

We tested the hypothesis that fouling by boring sponges will change the interaction strength between oysters and a common predator (stone crabs). We generated five oyster density treatments crossed with two sponge treatments (sponge and no sponge). We contrasted the interaction strength between stone crabs and fouled and non-fouled oysters by comparing the parameters of fitted functional response curves based on Rogers random predation model. We found that fouled oysters suffered higher predation from stone crabs, and that the increased predation risk stemmed from a reduction in the handling time needed to consume the fouled oysters. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the effects of abiotic changes on both the composition of ecological communities, and on the strengths of direct and indirect interactions among species.

Over 2 years (2011-2012), we evaluated naturally occurring fringing and patch intertidal oyster reefs in southeastern North Carolina, USA, to determine how varied reef type, size, and distance from edge to interior influenced the associated benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton. In addition, the effects of size and edge vs. interior were examined on constructed intertidal reefs at 2 different locations. On the natural reefs, species richness of benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton were significantly increased on fringing reefs. Benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased on large natural reefs, whereas mobile nekton richness significantly increased off of large reefs. Further, associated benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased along the reef edge, whereas mobile nekton diversity increased along the reef/open bottom interface. Species richness and densities for benthic macrofauna increased with created reef size, while there was greater species richness and diversity and dissimilar communities for mobile nekton along constructed reef edges. Habitat specificity may influence utilization for mobile nekton, as resident organisms with limited vagility had a stronger response to habitat characteristics. Thus, utilization of intertidal oyster reefs can be highly structured by habitat characteristics on many scales, and should be considered when examining species interactions, ecosystem management, and future restoration efforts.","10/13/17","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"57-70",NA,"","581",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000414582700005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Active settlement, passive settlement, and flow around these concavity treatments were examined. In addition, settlement on oyster shell cultch presented in different surface orientations, and either zip-tied to open mats, or packed in mesh bags, was examined. Results indicate that concavity can affect settlement success (W: D ratio of 5 resulted in the highest settlement success under this study's conditions). Examination of flow rates and patterns suggests that water movement over W: D 5 treatments delivers larvae to the settlement surface, but active attachment behavior is required to explain W: D 5's higher settlement densities relative to W:D 2. The highest settlement occurred with open mats on surfaces oriented horizontally and facing downward. Comparisons of mat, bag, and orientation results suggest that optimal current range for settlement is between 0.3 and 2.0 cm/sec.

Created reef success depends entirely on selecting a location that supports long-term oyster growth and survival, including the recruitment and survival of on-reef oysters. Significant changes in estuarine salinity through management of freshwater inflows and through changed precipitation patterns may significantly impact the locations of optimal oyster restoration sites. These rapid shifts in conditions necessitate a need to better understand both impacts to on-reef oyster growth and population development, and variation in oyster stock performance. Oyster growth, mortality, condition, and disease prevalence were examined in three different stocks of oysters located in protected cages, as well as oyster recruitment and mortality on experimental reef units in three different locations representing a salinity gradient, along the Louisiana Gulf coast in 2011 and 2012. Over a 2-y period, the high-salinity site had highest oyster growth rate in protected cages but demonstrated the least likelihood for reef development based on on-reef oyster population failure, likely because of predation-related mortality (high recruitment and 100% mortality). In contrast, the midsalinity site with moderate oyster growth and on-reef recruitment and low mortality demonstrated a higher likelihood for reef development. The lowest salinity site exhibited extreme variability in all oyster responses between years because of extreme variation in environmental conditions during the study, indicating a low likelihood of long-term reef development. Whereas limited differences in stock performance between sites were found, the range of site environmental conditions tested was ultimately much lower than expected and may not have provided a wide enough range of conditions. In areas with limited, low recruitment, or rapidly changing environmental conditions, seeding with stocks selected for best growth and survival under expected future environmental conditions could better ensure reef development by using oyster populations best suited to the predicted conditions. With rapidly changing estuarine conditions from anthropogenic activities and climate change, siting of oyster reef restoration incorporating both oyster population dynamics and in situ biotic and abiotic interactions is critical in better directing site selection for reef restoration efforts.","2017-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"341-351",NA,"2","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000408958300006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthering our understanding of how these habitats are evolving in the face of anthropogenic and climate driven changes will help improve management strategies. Previous work has shown that the growth and productivity of both oyster reefs and salt marshes are strongly linked to elevation in the intertidal zone (duration of aerial exposure). We build on that research by examining the growth of marsh-fringing oyster reefs at yearly to decadal time scales and examine movement of the boundary between oyster reef and salt marsh at decadal to centennial time scales. We show that the growth of marsh-fringing reefs is strongly associated to the duration of aerial exposure, with little growth occurring below mean low water and above mean sea level. Marsh-shoreline movement, in the presence or absence of fringing oyster reefs, was reconstructed using transects of sediment cores. Carbonaceous marsh sediments sampled below the modern fringing oyster reefs indicate that marsh shorelines within Back Sound, North Carolina are predominantly in a state of transgression (landward retreat), and modern oyster-reef locations were previously occupied by salt marsh within the past two centuries. Cores fronting transgressive marsh shorelines absent fringing reefs sampled thinner and less extensive carbonaceous marsh sediment than at sites with fringing reefs. This indicates that fringing reefs are preserving carbonaceous marsh sediment from total erosion as they transgress and colonize the exposed marsh shoreline making marsh sediments more resistant to erosion. The amount of marsh sediment preservation underneath the reef scales with the reef's relief, as reefs with the greatest relief were level with the marsh platform, preserving a maximum amount of carbonaceous sediments during transgression by buffering the marsh from erosional processes. Thus, fringing oyster reefs not only have the capacity to shelter shorelines but, if located at the ideal tidal elevation, they also keep up with accelerating sea-level rise and cap carbonaceous sediments, protecting them from erosion, as reefs develop along the marsh.","2017-07","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1013-1027",NA,"4","40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000402100700007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To assess the potential impact of green crabs on oyster mortality in relation to predator and prey size, we conducted multiple predator-prey manipulations in the field and laboratory. The surveys confirmed an ongoing green crab spread into new productive oyster habitats while rapidly increasing in numbers in areas where crabs had established already. The experiments measured mortality rates on four sizes of oysters exposed to three sizes of crab, and lasted 3-5 days. The outcomes of experiments conducted in Vexar bags, laboratory tanks and field cages were consistent and were heavily dependent on both crab size and oyster size: while little predation occurred on large oysters, large and medium green crabs preyed heavily on small sizes. Oysters reached a refuge within the 35-55 mm shell length range; below that range, oysters suffered high mortality due to green crab predation and thus require management measures to enhance their survival.

The physical reef structure and associated biotic parameters can affect the availability of food resources for oysters. Oysters and potential composite food sources - suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) - were assessed using a dual stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) approach at three reef types (natural, restored, and unconsolidated) seasonally for two years to determine if changes in physical and/or biotic parameters affected the relative availability and/or use of food resources by oysters. SPOM was more depleted in C-13 (-24.2 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, mean +/- SD) than SSOM (-21.2 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand). SPOM composition is likely dominated by autochthonous phytoplankton production, while SSOM includes trapped phytoplankton and benthic microalgae. SSOM was used by oysters in increasing proportions relative to SPOM over time at all reef types. This temporal trend is likely due to increased oyster biomass over time, promoting enhanced microphytobenthos growth through feedback effects related to oyster biodeposits. Structural differences between reef types observed in this study had no effect on food resource availability and use by oysters, indicating strong bentho-pelagic coupling likely due to shallow depths as well as strong and consistent winds. This study provides insights for restoration of oyster reefs as it highlights that food resources used by oysters remain similar among reef types despite changes in abiotic and biotic parameters among habitats and over time.

Further complicating the issue, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence are also expected to affect estuarine water quality. In this study, we developed a process-based numerical modeling system that couples hydrodynamic, water quality, and oyster population dynamics. We selected Breton Sound Estuary (BSE) (similar to 2740 km(2)) in the eastern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain since it is home to several of the largest public oyster seed grounds and private leases for the Gulf coast. The coupled oyster population model was calibrated and validated against field observed oyster growth data. We predicted the responses of oyster population in BSE to small-(142 m(3) s(-1)) and large-scale (7080 m(3) s(-1)) river diversions at the Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure planned in the 2012 Coastal Master Plan (Louisiana) under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative sea-level rise (RSLR=eustatic SLR+subsidence) compared to a baseline condition (Year 2009). Model results showed that the large-scale diversion had a stronger negative impact on oyster population dynamics via freshening of the entire estuary, resulting in reduced oyster growth rate and production than RSLR. Under the large-scale diversion, areas with optimal oyster growth rates (>15 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) oyster(-1) wk(-1)) and production (>500 g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)) would shift seaward to the southeastern edge of the estuary, turning the estuary into a very low oyster production system. RSLR however played a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of oyster growth rate and production. RSLR would result in an overall estuary-wide decrease in oyster growth rate and production as a consequence of decreased salinities in the middle and lower estuary because rising sea level likely causes increased stage and overbank flow downstream along the lower Mississippi River.

Additionally, the influences of distance from edge to interior locations and habitat patch size were examined for oyster populations on 3 size classes of created intertidal reefs at 2 locations. The habitat characteristics examined significantly influenced oyster populations, with increased densities towards interior locations on a reef, a trend of overall higher densities on intermediate sized reefs, significantly greater densities on natural patch reefs compared to natural fringing reefs. Density and recruitment patterns suggested differences between edge and interior locations. However, other population characteristics, such as oyster condition and shell height, indicated there may be ecological trade-offs among the habitat characteristics examined.

Restored oyster reefs are intended to provide substrata for sessile hard-fouling organisms such as barnacles, but the optimal configuration to encourage larval settlement has not yet been determined. Two common restoration strategies involve cultch, the shell material for reef restoration, in bags or on mats. Bags constitute quick, stackable construction with cultch packed haphazardly and limited space between shells. Mats utilize cultch sparingly and keep shells more exposed to currents. Although both restoration strategies are widely used, data comparing larval settlement between bags and mats are unavailable. We followed daily larval supply of the ivory barnacle Balanus eburneus (Gould, 1841) and corresponding settlement on cultch presented in bags and mats in a field study lasting one month in an estuary in eastern Florida, USA.

Recruitment densities of B. eburneus were as great as 7.6 +/- 0.54 SE individuals cm (2), and higher on mats than in bags (P = 0.0001).

Barnacles settling in late spring had larger basal diameters but relatively shorter feeding appendages in windward areas, compared to leeward areas; these morphological differences mirrored ADV measurements, verified long-term differences in flow and were indicative of bigger waves and higher flow velocities in windward locations. Thus, oyster reefs can reduce wave height and slow current velocity and influence the diversity, abundance, and morphology of associated species. The decrease in wave height can provide shoreline protection, an ecosystem service of oyster reefs often mentioned but rarely measured.","4/7/17","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"25-36",NA,"","569",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000400344700003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These highly productive, physically demanding ecosystems are populated by core species groups that often have strong trophic interactions with implications for ecosystem function and service provision. Positive interactions occur between ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) and cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Mussels transfer particulate nitrogen from the water column to the marsh sediments, which stimulates cordgrass growth, and cordgrass provides predator and/or heat stress refuge for mussels. Here, we test mussel facilitation of two functions in salt marshes that relate to N removal: microbial denitrification and water filtration. Microcosm experiments revealed that the highest rates of N-2 production and nitrification occurred when mussels were present with marsh vegetation, suggesting that mussels enhanced coupling of the nitrification-denitrification. Surveys spanning the York River Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, showed that the highest densities of mussels occurred in the first meter for all marsh types with mainstem fringing (1207 +/- 265 mussels/m(2)) being the most densely populated. The mussel population was estimated to be similar to 197 million animals with a water filtration potential of 90-135 million L/hr. Erosion simulation models demonstrated that suitable marsh habitat for ribbed mussels along the York River Estuary would be reduced by 11.8% after 50 years. This reduction in mussel habitat resulted in a projected 15% reduction in ribbed mussel abundance and filtration capacity. Denitrification potential was reduced in conjunction with projected marsh loss (35,536 m(2)) by 205 g N/hr, a 16% reduction. Because of the predominant occurrence of ribbed mussels at the marsh seaward edge and because the highest proportional loss will occur for fringing marshes (20%), shoreline management practices that restore or create fringing marsh may help offset these projected losses.","2017-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e01795",NA,"4","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000400985300041",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Effective restoration requires an understanding of the distribution, density, and demographic rates (growth and survival) of oysters inhabiting existing natural reefs and how these may vary as a function of landscape-scale factors, such as tidal range and fetch distances. Furthermore, natural intertidal habitats are increasingly being replaced with hardened shoreline structures that may be colonized by oysters, yet little is known about habitat quality (as indexed by oyster density and demographic rates) of these hardened structures relative to natural habitats. The present study sought to compare oyster density, demographic rates, and population estimates (1) across estuarine landscape settings to inform natural intertidal oyster reef restoration (i. e., comparing natural intertidal reefs within adjacent water bodies that vary in tidal regimes and fetch distances) and (2) across natural habitats and human-made structures to assess variation in habitat quality between natural reefs and hardened shorelines. Oyster density, growth rates, and population estimates on natural intertidal reefs were greatest within the smaller, more tidally influenced Core Sound versus the larger, wind-driven Pamlico Sound, with no significant difference in survivorship identified between the two water bodies. Natural intertidal reefs and hardened shoreline structures were compared within Pamlico Sound only, with natural intertidal reefs hosting three to eight times higher oyster densities than hardened shoreline structures. When mean oyster density/ m 2 was multiplied by reef area to estimate population size, natural intertidal reefs within Pamlico Sound hosted considerably greater populations of oysters relative to hardened shorelines. The present study fills an existing need to understand oyster density and demographic rates on natural intertidal reefs and hardened shorelines to better inform future restoration and shoreline management scenarios.","2017-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"87-100",NA,"1","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000399114600011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an attempt to understand the interaction between bivalve physiology and environmental conditions, filter-feeding assays were carried out in a shallow estuary, the Indian River Lagoon (IRL; Florida, USA). The feeding behavior of the bivalves was studied using in situ filter-feeding devices and the biodeposition method in the 3 basins of the IRL during March and August 2015. Water characteristics (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chl a, and total, organic, and inorganic particulates) were related to possible changes in the feeding physiology of the bivalves. Oysters had higher clearance rates, filtration rates, and rejection than clams. The high rejection of inorganic matter allowed oysters to increase the organic matter ingested, leading to high absorption efficiencies. In contrast, because clam rejection was low regardless of elevated levels of inorganic matter, their absorption efficiency only increased with higher organic matter content. Both species preferred higher salinities, and the amount of organic matter in the water had a negative relationship with some feeding parameters (filtration rate for both species, and rejection for oysters). Acute environ mental change brought about by a brown tide (caused by the alga Aureoumbra lagunensis) also affected these 2 bivalve species differently, supporting the hypothesis that oysters and clams have different physiological capabilities that drive their ability to survive in dynamic estuarine ecosystems.","3/13/17","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"125-137",NA,"","567",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000397823100009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present study characterized the role of wave exposure in determining the distribution of natural intertidal oyster reefs and of oysters on hardened shorelines (bulkhead and riprap revetments). Wave exposure was determined using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-developed Wave Exposure Model (WEMo), which integrates adjacent water depth, fetch, and processed wind information, among other variables.

Hardened shorelines and associated oyster densities were mapped for Pamlico Sound only. A narrow wave exposure threshold (similar to 500 J m(-1)) was identified above which natural intertidal reefs did not occur and below which reef presence was apparently dependent on other structuring variables, such as salinity at the time of sampling and the grain size of surrounding sediments.

We compared the development of a restored subtidal oyster reef to that of a natural reef for 29 months by assessing (1) community metrics (e.g., biomass, diversity), (2) the stable isotope composition of food sources and consumers, and ( 3) biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices. A clear shift in restored reef community composition occurred 12-15 months after restoration, moving from a community dominated by opportunistic species to a more diverse and evenly distributed community, similar to that of the natural reef. Consumer stable isotope values indicated that the restored reef community was supported by similar food resources and had similar food chain length as the natural reef community by 5-month post-restoration. However, biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices indicated that the magnitude of the main trophic pathways and characteristics of food web complexity in the restored reef did not recover to natural reef levels until 12-15 months after construction. The functional recovery of the restored reef community was driven by the homogenization of biomass distribution among trophic compartments as oysters and top predators increasingly colonized the reef. Results indicate that oyster reef restoration can support food web functions like those provided by natural reefs. We also demonstrate the importance of combining food web and community structure information in the study of ecological functioning.","2017-03","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"54",NA,"3","164",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000395180300017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in this economically valuable and ecologically important species.

Condition varied across oyster cohorts: Offspring of northern populations had better condition than offspring from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the southeastern Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and condition, yet offspring from local broodstock do not have higher survival or growth than those from farther away.

Oyster sampling units (OSUs) were deployed within intertidal oyster reef, and modified throw traps were used to collect macrofauna inhabiting the OSU and other adjacent vegetated habitats. Habitat arrangement and proximity as it relates to macrofaunal density, species richness, and community composition were also evaluated by comparing communities in oyster reef within the oyster reef complex, oyster reef adjacent to a seagrass complex, and oyster reef adjacent to marsh edge. Higher macrofaunal densities and species richness were observed within oyster reefs compared to seagrass and marsh edge. Oyster reef also supported a distinct community, while seagrass and marsh shared similar species composition and richness. The highest densities of macrofauna were collected on oyster reefs near seagrass and oyster reef located within the oyster reef complex. These results indicate the importance of intertidal oyster reefs to macrofauna and that reef location within the estuarine mosaic influences density and community assemblages.

Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions.

For reef-building oysters, reefs are maintained through accumulation of shell material, which depends on recruitment and growth and which provides substrate for new generations. Knowledge of the fundamental niche of oysters in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions helps define the area where ecosystem engineers grow and survive well and where their structures are likely to persist and be effective for coastal protection. Response curves of different life-history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated along a tidal emersion gradient in a manipulative field study. Density of juvenile oysters was maximal around 36% tidal emersion. Shell growth of juveniles and adults, condition index (CI) of adults and mortality of adults were negatively related to tidal emersion, whereas mortality of juveniles was positively related to tidal emersion. Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40% tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40% tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.","12/29/16","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"113-122",NA,"","562",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000394183600009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Resident mesopredators such as the xanthid mud crabs are abundant (>200/m(2)) on constructed subtidal oyster reefs in the New York metropolitan region and may contribute to post-settlement oyster mortality. Two study sites with differing mesopredator species, Hastings and Soundview Park, were selected to examine the role of small crustacean predators in post settlement mortality. The white-fingered mud crab (Rhithropanopeus horrisii) inhabits Hastings, whereas the flat mud crab (Eurvpanopeus depressus) and Sayi niud crab (Dyspanopeus sari) inhabit Soundview Park. Using size-selective mesh cages to exclude predators, the effects of predator size on oyster predation and recruitment at Hastings and Soundview Park were examined. Overall, Sound view Park had higher consumption rates than Hastings. The highest consumption at Soundview Park occurred when predators of all sizes had access to the oyster prey. Larger-sized predators were likely responsible for oyster mortality, as oyster mortality was not different between the mesopredator and no-predator treatment at Soundview Park. Few oysters recruited at Soundview Park: thus predator size effects on oyster recruitment could not be effectively evaluated between sites. Recruitment at Hastings was not affected by predator-exclusion treatments, in agreement with the oyster predation experiments. Though abundant, no mud crab mesopredator recovered at either site was greater than 22 mm in carapace width. Mesopredators were likely not of sufficient size to be dominant predators of newly settled juvenile oysters at Hastings and Soundview Park. Instead, predation pressure at Soundview Park was likely due to larger mobile predators such as blue (Callinccics sapidus) and spider crabs (Libinia spp.). Mesopredator size is an important factor to consider when evaluating mesopredator roles on oyster reefs.","2016-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"801-807",NA,"4","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398959000008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, findings of a key 1992 paper on Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery data and Apalachicola River discharge data from 1960 to 1984 were recreated, and the analysis extended to 1987 to 2013, to evaluate whether relationships previously reported between river discharge and oyster fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) persist. The originally reported relationship between low river discharge and lower oyster landings 2 y later was confirmed, but when these same relationships for data from 1987 to 2013 were examined, correlation coefficients relating river discharge metrics to oyster fishery CPUE that were significant with 1960 to 1984 data did not persist with data from 1987 to 2013. Combining all available data (1960 to 2013, excluding 1985 to 1986), previously reported significant correlation coefficients were found to have generally persisted or strengthened and the total number of significant correlations increased. A surprising result is the general lack of association between river discharge and oyster fishery landings from 1987 to 2013, a period of frequent drought and generally lower annual river discharge compared with 1960 to 1984. There are multiple possible explanations for the observed relationships between river discharge and oyster fishery landings including ( l) counterintuitive changes in oyster fishery landings due to a change in reporting requirements between the two epochs, (2) hyperstable relationship between oyster abundance and fishery CPI; E, (3) failure of the Apalachicola Bay oyster population to recover after Hurricane Elena, and (4) ecosystem changes possibly related to nonstationary river discharge levels altering Apalachicola River or Bay ecosystem dynamics in unknown ways. The absence of simple relationships between freshwater input and oyster fishery responses complicates ongoing management and restoration decisions for Apalachicola Bay, and this work demonstrates that, even within the same system, the relationship between freshwater discharge and response by a key estuarine ecosystem constituent is uncertain.","2016-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"809-825",NA,"4","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398959000009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To identify suitable areas for oyster restoration and aquaculture, areas of oyster suitable habitat must first be identified. A habitat suitability model is an ideal tool for identifying sites for species restoration. Because it relies on presence-only data, MaxEnt is a particularly useful habitat-suitability model for identifying restoration and species introduction sites. Habitat suitability models rely on the selection of environmental factors, which are assumed to be important for the target species; however, this selection of environmental factors is often arbitrary and there are few existing guidelines. This work applies an oyster habitat suitability model to the St. Louis Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Six environmental factors, namely average salinity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, water depth, minimum dissolved oxygen, and average total suspended solids were chosen to simulate habitat suitability. The environmental factors were obtained from a calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model of the estuary. The habitat suitability model was run with every possible combination of environmental factors, including one, two, three, four, five, and six inputs. Model results showed that at this location, salinity is the most important environmental input. Furthermore, model results showed that increasing the number of inputs optimizes model results. There is a diminishing return on the addition of environmental factors and there is a point at which the continued addition of environmental factors will not continue to notably improve model optimization. The ranges of simulated suitable values for the environmental factors were contextualized within measured values. This study shows how a statistical model can he used to identify restoration locations. It is a particularly compelling methodology because (1) it does not require prior information regarding suitable ranges of environmental factors; (2) it does not require information regarding the level of importance for those environmental factors; (3) it requires presence-only data; (4) results are based on spatiotemporal data at a finer scale than is generally measured in the field: and (5) model results can provide an additional line of evidence that complements knowledge by biologists and oystermen.","2016-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"841-849",NA,"4","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398959000012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Though Crassostrea virginica has never been commercially harvested, aboriginal people used the oyster substantially, accumulating middens between 5000 BC and AD 1700. A conservation paleobiological/historical ecological study of oysters from middens and modern reefs within Estero Bay (EB) and Pine Island Sound (PIS) determined if oyster productivity changed due to aboriginal overharvesting. Archaeological samples came from sites including the Late Archaic (LA, 2000-500 BC) of PIS and the Caloosahatchee (Cal, 500 BC-AD 1500) of EB and PIS. These samples were compared with natural oyster death assemblages from neighboring modern reefs. Methods comprised measuring oyster convex valve lengths and sectioning shells to count ligament pit growth lines that served as proxy for growth rate. The biologic taphonomic grade was also compared after scoring the interior valve surface; biologic grade is near pristine for oysters collected live for consumption. Archaeological samples exhibit significantly better taphonomic grades when compared to modern assemblages, confirming the hypothesis that oysters were harvested for food. Valve length decreased significantly from LA to Cal time, whereas modern assemblages were indistinguishable from LA collections. Because the Cal samples span 4 climatic intervals, the results suggest that climate change was not responsible for shifts in productivity. Results support the hypothesis of overharvesting during Cal times. They also suggest that modern oysters retain the capacity for growth, and indicate that aboriginal activity did not result in a permanent microevolutionary shift. The results are also relevant for the ongoing discussion surrounding the creation of an Anthropocene Epoch; the shell middens built throughout history greatly influenced both estuarine ecology and landscapes through fishing and engineering practices.

Oysters deliver material to the sediments through biodeposition and sedimentation caused by modification of flow around the reef. We conducted an experiment to distinguish between biotic effects and physical structure of oyster reefs on sediment nitrogen cycling. Experimental reefs consisting of live oysters, oyster shells alone and mudflats (controls) were sampled for a period of 4 wk for sediment organic matter, C and N content and fluxes of nitrogen (NH4+, NOX and N-2) and oxygen (O-2). We hypothesized that the biological activity of the oyster would deposit more, higher quality organic matter compared to deposition from flow modification alone, thus facilitating denitrification and having a larger impact on sediment nitrogen cycling. Compared to the controls, the live oyster experimental reefs increased sediment denitrification by 61% and the shell experimental reefs showed a 24% increase. The live oyster experimental reef also had the largest O-2 demand and NH4+ production. Reef structure likely increased organic matter deposition, but the higher quality and larger quantity of organic matter associated with live oysters increased denitrification and microbial respiration. This experiment shows that the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal provided by oysters is primarily driven by the biological function of the oysters and secondarily from the physical structure of the reef. Our increased understanding of how oysters engineer ecosystems and modify nutrient cycling can help guide future oyster restoration efforts.","11/24/16","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"173-183",NA,"","560",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000390104900012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These distinct morphologies are thought to form by interactions of nascent reef structures with hydrodynamics. We carried out two field studies to determine if historical reef configurations applied in a restoration context would improve reef persistence and restoration outcomes. We collected seabed and water column observations across constructed reefs of three orientations representative of those found historically throughout the oyster's range: parallel or perpendicular to tidal currents or circular. Areas adjacent to reefs were sites of fine sediment trapping, with lower flow velocities, evidence of particle settling, and more fine sediments on the seabed relative to off-reef reference sites. The water column above the reef crest exhibited higher acoustic backscatter, higher flow velocities, and larger particles in suspension, consistent with local erosion of flocculated fine sediment from the reef crest. Perpendicular reefs produced conditions that were more conducive to reef persistence and improved oyster performance, including high flow velocities and enhanced resuspension of sediments from the reef, compared to parallel or circular reefs. Particle trapping in areas between reefs has the potential to inhibit reef growth between existing reef structures, providing support for hypotheses of landscape-scale reef pattern formation. Oyster reef restoration efforts can benefit from this improved understanding of biophysical interactions arising from reef orientation that contribute to sediment dynamics on constructed oyster reefs.","2016-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1435-1448",NA,"5","39",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000380268400010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These die-off events have led to a conversion from shell to sandbar substrate and rapid loss of elevation (ca 8 cm/y). This process appears to be nonreversible, because oyster spat are unable to colonize sandy substrate. It is hypothesized that the addition of durable hard substrate would make reefs more resilient to periodic declines in freshwater flow by providing a persistent settlement site for extant larvae. This article reports a test of the assumption that oyster populations on these reefs are limited by substrate, and documents key effects on oysters, elevation, and avian usage associated with the addition of substrate. Durable substrate was added in the form of limerock cobbles and recycled clam Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758) aquaculture bags filled with cultch, live oysters, and associated fauna to eight paired treatment and control sites spaced along a highly degraded offshore reef chain. Elevation on treatment reefs increased postconstruction by an average of 16 cm. Mean oyster density on treatment sites increased by 2.653x on rock, 14.53x on clam bags, and 9.23x overall compared with control sites. Recycled clam bags contributed approximately 25% of the surface area on treatment reefs, but accounted for 52% of the oysters observed. Oyster densities on treatment sites were between 893 and 1253 those measured at a larger sample of nearby natural reefs, and exceeded the 89th percentile of reported densities at natural and restored reefs in the Gulf of Mexico. Total bird use was higher on treatment sites, but when controlled for elevation, all species but double-crested cormorants [Phalacrocorax auritus (Lesson, 1831)] and bald eagles [Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Linnaeus, 1766)] preferred control (sand bar) sites. These results indicate that (1) oyster recruitment can be strongly limited by available, durable substrate, especially in high-energy environments; (2) aquaculture byproduct materials can play a significant role in the process of restoration; and (3) restoration of oyster reefs and other living shorelines may have impacts on avian community composition.

The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use.

In monthly sampling, sixty of the largest oysters recruited onto the cultch were examined histologically to track the reproductive development of the initial settlers. Symbiont presence was also recorded. Sexual development was already occurring in August 2007, 56 days after cultch deployment, with immature males comprising 18% of the sample. Mature sperm and oocytes were observed in September 2007, 92 days following cultch deployment.

Effective application of these concepts to marine reserves is limited by data on demographic rates within reserves and larval connectivity among reserves. Using a network of reserves established to restore eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA as our model system, we integrated empirically based demographic rates and regional hydrodynamic-based connectivity estimates within a metapopulation model to (1) evaluate the potential for the reserve network to function as a self-persistent oyster metapopulation, (2) determine the relative importance of demographics vs. connectivity on reserve source-sink dynamics, (3) assess the efficacy of stock enhancement in promoting metapopulation persistence, and (4) evaluate whether application of a Few Large or Several Small reserves-a modification of the Single Large or Several Small concept-promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae within the reserve network (i.e., local larval retention within reserves + larval connectivity among reserves). The reserve network failed to function as a self-persistent metapopulation, despite exceptional demographic rates within reserves. When considering only larval supply from reserves, local retention and connectivity were insufficient to provide annual replacement (>=similar to 0.25 recruits per adult). Accordingly, reserves contributed to the metapopulation primarily via production, not dispersal, of larvae and reserve source-sink dynamics were influenced more by demographics within reserves, particularly adult growth and survival, than larval connectivity among reserves. Addressing recruitment limitation via stock enhancement was not effective at augmenting projected metapopulation declines. Several small reserves initially promoted greater metapopulation retention of larvae than a few large reserves, however, as the number or area of reserves increased, metapopulation retention was equivalent among designs, suggesting that Few Large and Several Small reserves may be the best network design. Marine reserves can be an effective restoration tool for improving demographic rates within reserve boundaries, but designation of multiple reserves does not guarantee a functional reserve network metapopulation. Both demographics and larval connectivity are important considerations to successful application of metapopulation concepts to the design of reserve networks.","2016-06","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e01322",NA,"6","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000378523100012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Examining how genetic diversity relates to demographic traits provides a key mechanistic link from genotypic and phenotypic variation of taxa with complex life histories to their population dynamics. We conducted a field experiment to assess how two metrics of intraspecific diversity (cohort diversity, the number of independent juvenile cohorts created from different adult source populations, and genetic relatedness, genetic similarity among individuals within and across cohorts) affect the survivorship, growth, and recruitment of the foundation species Crassostrea virginica. To assess the effects of both cohort diversity and genetic relatedness on oyster demographic traits under different environmental conditions, we manipulated juvenile oyster diversity and predator exposure (presence/absence of a cage) at two sites differing in resource availability and predation intensity. Differences in predation pressure between sites over-whelmingly determined post-settlement survivorship of oysters. However, in the absence of predation (i.e., cage treatment), one or both metrics of intraspecific diversity, in addition to site, influenced long-term survivorship, growth, and recruitment. While both cohort diversity and genetic relatedness were negatively associated with long-term survivorship, genetic relatedness alone showed a positive association with growth and cohort diversity alone showed a positive association with recruitment. Thus, our results demonstrate that in the absence of predation, intraspecific diversity can affect multiple demographic traits of a foundation species, but the relative importance of these effects depends on the environmental context. Moreover, the magnitude and direction of these effects vary depending on the diversity metric, cohort diversity or genetic relatedness, suggesting that although they are inversely related in this system, each captures sufficiently different components of intraspecific diversity. Given the global loss of oyster reef habitat and rapid decline in oyster population size, our results are particularly relevant to management and restoration. In addition, aquaculture, which commonly excludes predators during early life history stages, may benefit from incorporation of oyster cohort diversity into standard practice.","2016-06","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1518-1529",NA,"6","97",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000377219900015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We carried out a field experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico where we compared areas shoreward of created reefs with adjacent reef-free areas over several years using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design. The reefs were built with oyster shell, measured 65 m, and were placed at circa 100 m from the shoreline to ensure subtidal conditions and enhance oyster recruitment. The BACI results showed few and disparate effects of the reefs, even when distance from the reef was factored in. However, we found a temporal increase in seagrass cover throughout all the experimental area (i.e. including both reef and control plots) following reef deployment. Interestingly, further analysis with satellite imagery showed the experimental area had higher seagrass cover 5 years after reef deployment than it did before reef deployment, but such increase was not observed for nearby areas. In concert, the results suggest ""shadow"" effects for the reefs examined, where positive effects on seagrass beds extend beyond the area directly shoreward from the reef.

A field trial was performed to investigate whether the remote set of oysters can be used to restock natural beds during mortalities caused by disease epizootics and lack of recruitment due to periods without sets. Disease-resistant oysters were remote set in a hatchery and placed either in or without biodegradable nets on a natural bed. Aged, clean cultch was used as the control, and the growth, mortality, predation, fouling, and prevalence of disease were monitored for two growing seasons. The oysters grew to market size (3 inches, 76.2 mm) in 15 mo. Predation, due mainly to Atlantic oyster drills Urosalpinx cinerea, and overgrowth of oysters caused a mortality of 72% in the oyster seed during the first growing season. More abundant wild oysters set but fewer fouling organisms landed on the remote-set shells than on the clean cultch. To evaluate the effect of siltation on mortality, the oysters were left on the natural bed instead of being transplanted to growing areas, as is standardly done in commercial shellfishing operations. During the second growing period, siltation caused additional mortality until only 1.5% of the oysters deployed were alive. The method of restocking natural beds in Connecticut with remote-set oyster seed for use by the oyster industry looks promising due to the fast growth of the oyster seed. This experiment also demonstrates the challenges presented by nonharvest oyster restoration activities due to significant siltation-associated mortality.","2016-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"115-125",NA,"1","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000376743800013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Structured habitats serve as nursery grounds by enhancing juvenile fish and mobile crustacean survival and abundance. This service is challenging to quantify due to ontogenetic shifts in habitat use by many species. We reviewed available literature on the increased abundance of juvenile fish and mobile crustaceans in a key nursery habitat - Crassostrea virginica reefs in the USA. We modelled the growth and mortality of the enhanced species using three different natural mortality (M) estimates to provide estimates of the gross and net lifetime production and uncertainty that can be attributed to the habitat. Recruitment of nineteen and twelve species were found to be enhanced by the addition of C.virginica reefs to previously unstructured habitat in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic USA, respectively. This increased recruitment is estimated to result in a mean lifetime enhancement in production of 397115 (1SD) gm(-2)year(-1) in the Gulf of Mexico and 28156gm(-2)year(-1) in the South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic. The two regions differed with regard to the identity of the enhanced species and their degree of augmentation. Thus, our results highlight the inadequacy of applying regional estimates of ecosystem services to global scales. Furthermore, estimates of total enhancement varied by up to a factor of 28 across the three methods of M estimation. Our estimates are quantitative predictions of the ecological benefits derived from the restoration or conservation of a threatened habitat, and advance the field of restoration science beyond qualitative statements that just predict direction of benefit (e.g. increased or decreased). Quantification of the uncertainty in the production estimates further increases their utility for decision-makers.Synthesis and applications.

Although remote setting is effective, inefficiencies exist. Repeated shell handling, spat mortality during transport, and decreased cultch supply suggest that other restoration methods merit consideration. We present the results of the first known field test of directly seeding a submerged oyster reef with larvae and setting an additional cohort on the reef the following year. We surrounded a 65 m(2) reef located in 2.5 m of water with a flexible enclosure and added 2.3 x 10(6) larvae. Larvae were allowed 3 d to set on either clean or fouled shell valves, after which we removed the enclosure. Setting efficiencies in the enclosure (spat produced per larvae introduced), were 26 and 7% for clean and fouled shell, respectively, in 2012, and 10 and 16% in 2013. These are comparable to published remote setting efficiencies, and were significantly higher than in our representative shoreside tank. Spat densities on site 1 mo post-set (median = 189 spat m(-2)) and the following spring (115 juveniles m(-2)) met best practice restoration metrics. Larvae were re-set on the reef in 2013, but in lower densities than 2012, supplementing the reef with 23 spat m(-2).

High relief reefs are more productive and resilient than low relief reefs, in part, because increasing reef height reduces sedimentation and enhances oyster growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between initial reef height and reef development using a simple model. The model contains three coupled differential equations that describe changes in oyster volume, shell volume, and sediment volume per unit area of reef with time. The model was used to investigate how parameters such as flow speed, sediment grain size, and food concentration affect reef survival and final reef height. Whether or not a reef survives depends primarily on the shape of the sediment concentration profile relative to the initial reef height. Over a long time period, three different steady-state reef heights are possible, depending on the environmental parameters and initial reef height: (1) If growth outpaces sedimentation, the reef achieves the maximum possible height, which is independent of sedimentation parameters; (2) if deposition outpaces growth and the shear stress does not exceed the critical shear stress, the reef is buried in sediment and dies; and (3) if deposition outpaces growth and the shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress, a reduced steady-state height is achieved that depends on both growth and sedimentation parameters.

Very low salinity occurring during extreme (disturbance) canal flows produced large negative direct and total effects on small oysters, but no significant total effect for adult oysters. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) during normal canal flow had negative total effects on small oysters but positive total effects on adult oysters.

The capacity of coastal ecosystems, like marshes and oyster reefs, to maintain their own habitat and grow with sea-level rise via biophysical feedbacks is seen as an important advantage of such systems compared to man-made hard engineering structures. Providing a suitable substrate for oysters to settle on offers a kick-start for establishment at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Accumulation of shell material, through recruitment and growth, is essential to the maintenance of oyster reefs as it provides substrate for new generations (positive feedback loop), forming a self-sustainable structure. Insight in establishment, survival and growth thresholds and knowledge about the population dynamics are necessary to successfully implement oyster reefs in coastal defence schemes. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether artificial Pacific oyster reefs develop into self-sustaining oyster reefs that contribute to coastal protection. Reef development was investigated by studying recruitment, survival and growth rates of oysters on artificial oyster reefs in comparison with nearby natural Pacific oyster reefs. The artificial reef structure successfully offered substrate for settlement of oysters and therefore stimulated reef formation. Reef development, however, was hampered by local sedimentation and increasing tidal emersion. Tidal emersion is an important factor that can be used to predict where artificial oyster reefs have the potential to develop into self-sustaining reefs that could contribute to coastal protection, but it is also a limiting factor in using oyster reefs for coastal protection.

While considerable effort and resources have been implemented into restoring these important environmental engineers, the success of oyster populations is often limited by poor understanding of site-specific dispersal patterns of propagules. Water-borne transport is a key factor controlling or regulating the dispersal of the larval stage of benthic marine invertebrates which have limited mobility. The distribution of the native oyster Ostrea edulis in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, together with their densities and population structure at subtidal and intertidal sites has been documented at irregular intervals between 1997 and 2013. This paper revisits this historical data and considers whether different prevailing environmental conditions can be used to explain the distribution, densities and population structure of O. edulis in Strangford Lough. The approach adopted involved comparing predictive 2D hydrodynamic models coupled with particle tracking to simulate the dispersal of oyster larvae with historical and recent field records of the distribution of both subtidal and intertidal, populations since 1995. Results from the models support the hypothesis that commercial stocks of 0. edulis introduced into Strangford Lough in the 1990s resulted in the re-establishment of wild populations of oysters in the Northern Basin which in turn provided a potential source of propagules for subtidal populations. These results highlight that strategic site selection (while inadvertent in the case of the introduced population in 1995) for the re-introduction of important shellfish species can significantly accelerate their recovery and restoration.

Previous work focused on fluxes of N solutes and gases, but the effects on microbes responsible for N transformations are unknown. In May 2010, we deployed eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in mesh cages above sand-filled boxes at four sites across a nutrient gradient in Jamaica Bay, New York City. In fall and winter, we used quantitative PCR to measure abundance of 16S rRNA and nitrite reductase genes for denitrification (nirS and nirK) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (nrfA) in sediment. We measured water column nutrients and chlorophyll a, sediment C:N and organic matter (OM), exchangeable ammonium (NH4 (+)), ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification potential (DNP). Oysters did not affect gene abundance in fall, when we predicted that their influence would be strongest, or in winter. However, gene abundance was significantly different among sites and seasons. Factors which explained 16S rRNA, nirS, and nirK gene abundance included sediment OM, water column N, and chlorophyll a, similar to previous research. Abundance of nrfA was lower than that of nir genes and positively related to sediment C:N, suggesting OM lability may drive the balance between nir and nrfA.

Oyster restoration and aquaculture are both hypothesized to mitigate excessive nitrogen (N) loads via benthic denitrification. The degree to which these management activities perform similar functions for removing N, however, has not been extensively examined in New England, a place where nutrient runoff is high and increasing oyster (Crassostrea virginica) restoration and aquaculture activity is taking place. Here, we use a novel in situ methodology to directly measure net N-2 and O-2 fluxes across the sediment-water interface in a shallow (similar to 1 m) coastal pond in southern Rhode Island. We collected data seasonally during 2013 and 2014 at restored oyster reefs, oyster aquaculture, oyster cultch (shell), and bare sediment. Restored oyster reefs and aquaculture had the highest mean (+/- SE) denitrification rates, 581.9 (+/- 164.2) and 346 (+/- 168.6) mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1), respectively, and are among the highest recorded for oyster-dominated environments. Denitrification rates at sites with oyster cultch were 60.9 (+/- 44.3) mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1), which is substantially less than the sites with active oysters but still more than 50% higher than denitrification rates measured in bare sediment (24.4 +/- 10.1 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)). The increase in denitrification rates at treatments, however, varied by season and the greatest rates for restored reefs were in the fall. Overall, the greatest aggregate denitrification rates occurred in the fall. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) followed similar patterns but with greater overall rates in the summer, and displayed a strong linear relationship with denitrification (R-2 = 0.93). Our results demonstrate that habitats associated with live oysters have higher net denitrification rates and that oyster reef restoration and oyster aquaculture may provide similar benefits to the ecosystem in terms of N removal. However, gas fluxes may also be affected where three-dimensional structure is introduced via oyster shell cultch and this appears to be seasonally-dependent. These data will be important for managers as they incorporate oysters into nutrient reduction strategies and consider system-level trade-offs in services provided by oyster reef restoration and aquaculture activities.","2016","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"UNSP 74",NA,"","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457358000073",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, of the eight HSI models developed for eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) restoration and fishery production, none has been validated. Consequently, we developed, calibrated, and validated an HSI for the eastern oyster to identify optimal habitat for restoration in a tributary of Chesapeake Bay, the Great Wicomico River (GWR). The GWR harbors a high density, restored oyster population, and therefore serves as an excellent model system for assessing the validity of the HSI. The HSI was derived from GIS layers of bottom type, salinity, and water depth (surrogate for dissolved oxygen), and was tested using live adult oyster density data from a survey of high vertical relief reefs (HRR) and low vertical relief reefs (LRR) in the sanctuary network. Live adult oyster density was a statistically-significant sigmoid function of the HSI, which validates the HSI as a robust predictor of suitable oyster reef habitat for rehabilitation or restoration. In addition, HRR had on average 103-116 more adults m(-2) than LRR at a given level of the HSI. For HRR, HSI >= 0.3 exceeded the accepted restoration target of 50 live adult oysters m(-2). For LRR, the HSI was generally able to predict live adult oyster densities that meet or exceed the target at HSI >= 0.3. The HSI indicated that there remain large areas of suitable habitat for restoration in the GWR. This study provides a robust framework for HSI model development and validation, which can be refined and applied to other systems and previously developed HSIs to improve the efficacy of native oyster restoration.","2016","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"UNSP 64",NA,"","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457358000063",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several commonly used oyster restoration techniques were examined to determine which would be the most successful for restoring the Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida in Newport Bay, CA. Replicate (n = 5) 232 m shell beds were constructed of two initial shell planting thicknesses (bed thicknesses of 4 versus 12 cm) and two methods of deployment (bagged versus loose shell). Shell cover, oyster spatfall (settlement), oyster recruitment, and adult oyster densities were analyzed over 2 y; 12-cm-thick oyster beds maintained higher shell cover, experienced less sedimentation, and received greater numbers of oyster recruits than 4-cm-thick beds. There was no significant effect of shell deployment method on shell cover, recruitment, or adult density; however, spatfall was greater on loose shell beds compared with bagged shell beds in the final year of the study. Overall, augmenting mudflat habitat with oyster shell significantly increased adult O. lurida oyster density compared with unmanipulated plots and increased oyster density relative to the average density of oysters measured elsewhere in Newport Bay. Collectively, the data suggest that building thicker shell beds might increase the longevity of a constructed shell bed, and therefore, this approach is recommended for future restoration activities in southern California.

One way to assess oyster population structure and the potential suitability of oyster restoration sites is through deployment of adult oyster shells or other substrates, and quantifying oyster spat settlement. The suitability of travertine tiles versus axenic adult oyster shells for C. virginica settlement was compared by deploying shellstrings with tiles and shells in four different locations across two seasons (fall or spring) in the subtropical, Loxahatchee River estuary, FL. There was no significant difference in spat densities on oyster shells compared with tile tops and bottoms, although there was significant spatial and temporal variation in spat settlement. Spat were slightly more abundant on the top of deployed tiles compared with the bottom, which differs from typical C. virginica settlement behavior. One possible explanation may be the presence of other fouling organisms on the bottom of tiles which decrease oyster settlement rates. Results show that oyster spat settlement was indistinguishable between travertine tiles and oyster shells and thus suggest that travertine tiles are preferable to axenic oyster shells because spat settlement can be precisely quantified per unit area.","2015-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"861-865",NA,"3","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000367745300015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One industry was in Connecticut-New York, Long Island Sound, and the other was on Prince Edward Island (PEI), eastern Canada. Both industries were far smaller than they had been and were in a state of degradation. The programs featured identification of factors that limited oyster abundances on the beds, and then taking immediate steps to reduce their effects. They also featured using information and ideas from the oyster managers in Connecticut, and oystermen and public fisheries officials on PEI. The programs included observing the beds and oysters using scuba. The Connecticut beds received too few shells to collect seed oysters, and mortalities of seed were high. The oyster beds on PEI had been scarcely cultivated. The restoration program in Connecticut lasted for 5 y, 1966 to 1970, and on PEI was for 1 y, 1972 to 1973, but it continued afterward. The Connecticut oysters increased in abundance when oystermen effectively spread more shells to collect seed and reduced mortalities of the seed by controlling starfish Asterias forbesi (Desor, 1848), oyster drills Usosalpinx cinerea (Say, 1822), and Eupleura caudata (Say, 1822), and ""winter-kill.'' The Connecticut-New York landings rose from 62,000 bushels in 1965 to 348,000 bushels in 1975, an increase of 5.6-fold. On PEI, surveys found large quantities of oysters in nonharvested locations and also large deposits of fossil oyster shells. The island's first oyster-dredging boat was constructed to transplant oysters and shells to previously barren bottoms for oystermen to harvest. During the summer of 1973, a total of 53,000 bushels of oysters and shells were transplanted. Prince Edward Island oyster landings increased from 17,000 bushels in 1972 to 97,000 bushels in 2005, a 5.7-fold increase. Individual PEI oystermen did not increase their harvests substantially, but employment in the industry increased from about 200 to 500-700 men over that time. The two programs showed that oyster abundances and their landings can be raised rapidly in oyster industries under both private and public control by following their approaches that feature solving immediate production problems and using a holistic management approach.","2015-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"867-878",NA,"3","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000367745300016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Funding limitations can prevent adequate monitoring, but we suggest that the lack of accepted metrics to address the diversity of restoration objectives also presents a serious challenge to the monitoring of restoration projects. A working group with experience in designing and monitoring oyster reef projects was used to develop standardized monitoring metrics, units, and performance criteria that would allow for comparison among restoration sites and projects of various construction types. A set of four universal metrics (reef areal dimensions, reef height, oyster density, and oyster size-frequency distribution) and a set of three universal environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) are recommended to be monitored for all oyster habitat restoration projects regardless of their goal(s). In addition, restoration goal-based metrics specific to four commonly cited ecosystem service-based restoration goals are recommended, along with an optional set of seven supplemental ancillary metrics that could provide information useful to the interpretation of prerestoration and postrestoration monitoring data. Widespread adoption of a common set of metrics with standardized techniques and units to assess well-defined goals not only allows practitioners to gauge the performance of their own projects but also allows for comparison among projects, which is both essential to the advancement of the field of oyster restoration and can provide new knowledge about the structure and ecological function of oyster reef ecosystems.","2015-11","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"737-745",NA,"6","23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000363671300003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of diel-cycling dissolved oxygen (DO) and co-varying diel-cycling pH on infections of Perkinsus spp. and hemocyte activity in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Perkinsus marinus is the protistan parasite that causes Dermo disease in oysters. Severe diel-cycling DO increased the acquisition and progression of Perkinsus infections during exposure, and had a legacy effect the next year. Diel-cycling pH did not significantly affect infection dynamics either on its own or in combination with diel-cycling DO. Diel-cycling DO and pH both individually and in conjunction stimulated hemocyte activity, although this stimulated activity may not be effective at preventing Perkinsus infection.

We found that oyster reef growth is unimodal relative to emergence, with greatest growth rates occurring between 20-40% exposure, and zero-growth boundaries at 10% and 55% exposures. Notably, along the lower growth boundary (10%), increased rates of SLR would outpace reef accretion, thereby reducing the depth range of substrate suitable for reef maintenance and formation, and exacerbating habitat loss along developed shorelines.

Unfortunately, many reefs have been degraded or removed completely, and there are increased efforts to restore oysters in many coastal areas.

Such fringing reef approaches, however, often lack empirical data to identify locations where reefs are most effective in reducing marsh erosion, or fully take into account habitat suitability. Using monitoring data from 5 separate fringing reef projects across coastal Louisiana, we quantify shoreline exposure (fetch + wind direction + wind speed) and reef impacts on shoreline retreat. Our results indicate that fringing oyster reefs have a higher impact on shoreline retreat at higher exposure shorelines. At higher exposures, fringing reefs reduced marsh edge erosion an average of 1.0 m y(-1). Using these data, we identify ranges of shoreline exposure values where oyster reefs are most effective at reducing marsh edge erosion and apply this knowledge to a case study within one Louisiana estuary. In Breton Sound estuary, we calculate shoreline exposure at 500 random points and then overlay a habitat suitability index for oysters. This method and the resulting visualization show areas most likely to support sustainable oyster populations as well as significantly reduce shoreline erosion.

In addition to supporting valuable aquaculture and wild-harvest industries, their populations determine the structure of benthic communities, cycling of nutrients, serve as prey resources for higher trophic levels and, in some instances, stabilize shorelines and maintain water quality. This paper reviews existing knowledge of the ecology of host-parasite interactions involving marine molluscs, with a focus on gastropods and bivalves. It considers the ecological and evolutionary impacts of molluscan parasites on their hosts and vice versa, and on the communities and ecosystems in which they are a part, as well as disease management and its ecological impacts. An increasing number of case studies show that disease can have important effects on marine molluscs, their ecological interactions and ecosystem services, at spatial scales from centimeters to thousands of kilometers and timescales ranging from hours to years. In some instances the cascading indirect effects arising from parasitic infection of molluscs extend well beyond the temporal and spatial scales at which molluscs are affected by disease. In addition to the direct effects of molluscan disease, there can be large indirect impacts on marine environments resulting from strategies, such as introduction of non-native species and selective breeding for disease resistance, put in place to manage disease. Much of our understanding of impacts of molluscan diseases on the marine environment has been derived from just a handful of intensively studied marine parasite-host systems, namely gastropod-trematode, cockle-trematode, and oyster-protistan interactions. Understanding molluscan host-parasite dynamics is of growing importance because: (I) expanding aquaculture; (2) current and future climate change; (3) movement of non-native species; and (4) coastal development are modifying molluscan disease dynamics, ultimately leading to complex relationships between diseases and cultivated and natural molluscan populations. Further, in some instances the enhancement or restoration of valued ecosystem services may be contingent on management of molluscan disease. The application of newly emerging molecular tools and remote sensing techniques to the study of molluscan disease will be important in identifying how changes at varying spatial and temporal scales with global change are modifying host-parasite systems.

For the management of marine shellfish resources, marine diseases pose additional challenges in early intervention after the appearance of disease, management of the diseased population to limit a decline in host abundance, and application of measures to restrain that decline once it occurs. Mathematical models provide one approach for quantifying these effects and addressing the competing goals of managing the diseased population versus managing the disease. The majority of models for molluscan diseases fall into three categories distinguished by these competing goals. (1) Models that consider disease effects on the host population tend to focus on pathogen proliferation within the host. Many of the well-known molluscan diseases are pandemic, in that they routinely reach high prevalence rapidly over large geographic expanses, are characterized by transmission that does not depend upon a local source, and exert a significant influence on host population dynamics. Models focused on disease proliferation examine the influence of environmental change on host population metrics and provide a basis to better manage diseased stocks. Such models are readily adapted to questions of fishery management and habitat restoration. (2) Transmission models are designed to understand the mechanisms triggering epizootics, identify factors impeding epizootic development, and evaluate controls on the rate of disease spread over the host's range. Transmission models have been used extensively to study terrestrial diseases, yet little attention has been given to their potential for understanding the epidemiology of marine molluscan diseases. For management of diseases of wild stocks, transmission models open up a range of options, including the application of area management, manipulation of host abundance, and use of scavengers and filter feeders to limit the concentration of infective particles. (3) The details of host population processes and pathogen transmission dynamics are blended in models that evaluate the effects of natural selection and/or genetic modification in developing disease resistance in the host population. Application of gene-based models to marine diseases is only now beginning and represents a promising approach that may provide a mechanistic basis for managing marine diseases and their host populations. Overall disease models remain both uncommon and underutilized in addressing the needs for managing molluscan diseases and their host populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Rather than focusing on a single habitat such as oysters or mangroves or SAV, we took an approach restoring multiple adjacent habitats to accelerate restoration in a Florida embayment that had been significantly degraded prior to the restoration of natural tidally generated flows. After a multiple habitat die-off, a project was initiated in 2006 to reintroduce tidal flushing. The re-introduction of tidal flushing, however, did not result in immediate recovery of mangrove shorelines or oyster-dominated reefs. There was a lack of mangrove propagule production and significant substrate limitation in areas with appropriate salinity, sediment and tidal flows. From 2009-2012, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) propagules were collected (over 500,000) and planted for a total area of 3.24 ha. From 2009-2010, five intertidal reefs were constructed by adding bagged and fossil shell (54 MT) for Crassostrea virginica larvae to recruit onto totaling over 779 m(2). Monitoring of planted mangrove versus unplanted shorelines demonstrated that prop root and drop root densities were higher where propagules were planted (28 m(-2)) versus unplanted (2.3 m(-2)). Oyster densities and mean sizes (multiple year classes) at new and natural reefs were measured after 8, 12, and 24, and 36 months. An initial settlement pulse was observed in the first 8 months followed by an increase in the density of greater than 1-year old oysters. Xanthid crab densities (Eurypanopeus depressus and Panopeus spp.) in restored reefs and natural reefs were similar, while Petrolisthes armatus densities were lower in restored reefs. Whole reef seston filtration rates over restored reefs were -26 to 157 L m(-2) h(-1) when measured at 4,15, 28, and 40 months. A multiple habitat approach may be useful in accelerating the natural ecological succession, especially if the project site has reached a degraded, alternate ecological state. These results suggest a multiple habitat approach can be useful in providing non-provisioning ecosystem services to a Florida embayment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Delivery of competent larvae to reefs is influenced by larval behavior, which respond to elevated levels of turbulence by a downward swimming behavior. To determine the geographic dispersal of populations of oyster larvae and how swimming behavior of larvae alters settlement patterns within Virginia (USA) coastal bays, this study utilized a depth-averaged Delft3D(C) hydrodynamic model coupled to a larval behavior model which incorporates an increased downward swimming speed in response to elevated turbulence. Turbulence and flow measurements over oyster reefs, oyster restoration sites, and bare seafloor were quantified using velocimeters. Hydrodynamic cues were input into the larval behavior model to determine how changes in swimming behavior due to turbulence influence settlement patterns. Results indicate that alterations in settlement velocity, specifically maintaining approximate neutral buoyancy until larvae are both mature and over an existing reef, substantially increased the probability of settling on suitable substrate. We also found that oyster reefs in low velocity regions have a higher probability of self-colonization, while reefs found in less sheltered higher velocity environments receive comparatively little of their own larvae and depend upon connectivity with other areas. Data from in situ larval settlement plates agree with model results and indicate that rates of settlement are similar to 1.5 to 3x greater over existing reefs composed of primarily vertically oriented oysters than over restoration reefs that are less topographically complex.","9/15/15","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"161-176",NA,"","535",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000361694000011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a result, justification for management activities increasingly asks for two lines of evidence: (1) biological proof of augmented ecosystem function or service, and (2) monetary valuation of these services. For oyster reefs, which have seen significant global declines and increasing restoration work, the need to provide both biological and monetary evidence of reef services on a local-level has become more critical in a time of declining resources. Here, we quantified species biomass and potential commercial value of nekton collected from restored oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in coastal Louisiana over a 3-year period, providing multiple snapshots of biomass support over time. Overall, and with little change over time, fish and invertebrate biomass is 212% greater at restored oyster reefs than mud-bottom, or 0.12 kg m(-2). The additional biomass of commercial species is equivalent to an increase of local fisheries value by 226%, or $0.09 m(-2). Understanding the ecosystem value of restoration projects, and how they interact with regional management priorities, is critical to inform local decision-making and provide testable predictions. Quantitative estimates of potential commercial fisheries enhancement by oyster reef restoration such as this one can be used directly by local managers to determine the expected return on investment.","8/25/15","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e1111",NA,"","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000360847900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Consequently, emphasis has shifted to the use of alternative oyster reef materials, which need to be tested for their effectiveness as settlement substrate. Furthermore, low recruitment of wild larvae has also impeded restoration, indicating a need to assess the potential of field setting of cultured larvae. We experimentally examined oyster settlement, growth and survival on unconsolidated OS, vertically embedded oyster shell (ES) in concrete, and concrete Oyster Castles (OC) in field and mesocosm experiments. In addition, we examined settlement success of cultured larvae in the mesocosm experiment. In the field experiment, juvenile recruitment was 3 higher on castles and unconsolidated shell than on embedded shell. Castles retained 4Xthe number of oysters and hosted 5Xthe biomass than embedded shell, and retained 1.5Xthe oysters and hosted 3Xthe biomass than unconsolidated shell. The proportion of live oyster recruits on castles was 1.5Xthat on both embedded and unconsolidated shell. In the mesocosm experiment (90-d postlarval deployment), the castles recruited, retained, and hosted an oyster biomass 4Xhigher than that of unconsolidated and embedded shell. This study confirms that artificial reef materials, such as OC, are suitable alternative substrates for oyster restoration, and remote setting of larvae can be effective under controlled environmental conditions. Future restoration efforts should consider use of alternative reef substrates and field setting of larvae, where recruitment is limited, to maximize oyster recruitment, while simultaneously minimizing the cost of reef restoration.","2015-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"241-250",NA,"2","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000360410500005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The severe loss of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica has encouraged different types of restoration efforts in the United States. In Mosquito Lagoon (ML), a shallow-water estuary on the east coast of central Florida, restoration focuses on providing additional substrate for larval recruitment via deployment of stabilized oyster shell. To assess the current number and area of natural, dead, and restored oyster reefs within ML, aerial photographs from 2009 were digitized using ArcGIS software. All reefs were screen digitized using a reef ""signature"" to estimate the surface area of each reef type. The maps from 2009 were then used as a guide to digitizing the historical aerial photographs (1943, 1951, 1967, 1971, 1984, 1995, and 2006). Oyster habitat within ML has decreased by almost 15 hectares between 1943 and 2009, which constitutes 24% of the 1943 lagoon-wide coverage. The impacts were greater in Canaveral National Seashore, which covers the southern ML; 40% of the oyster coverage within the park has been lost since 1943. Dead reefs were found adjacent to important boating channels. Tracked dead reefs exhibited a continuous migration into the mangrove islands located landward of the original live reefs, with some dead reefs completely washing up into the marsh. Restoration of dead reefs with stabilized oyster shells has added nearly 1 hectare of live oyster habitat to ML as of January 2009. This research demonstrates that dead reefs are increasing in number and coverage within ML, but this trend can be reversed with restoration.","2015-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"251-258",NA,"2","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000360410500006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using transplanted oysters, Crassostrea virginica, the potential of using an aquaculture approach to grow, harvest, and therefore remove nitrogen from coastal bays with high nutrient input was studied. Jamaica Bay-urban high nitrogen input (input; similar to 5.8x10(6) kgN/y)-was contrasted with Great South Bay-suburban and medium nitrogen input (input; similar to 8.5x10(5) kgN/y)-both located on the south shore of western Long Island, NY. A growth period of June-October was used with a harvest in October as the basis for an estimate, and nitrogen in soft tissues and shell was measured in October, minus the starting values, because both tissue and shell would be removed at the time of harvest. Nitrogen sequestration potential was determined from growth in aquaculture cages, extrapolated to 50% cage coverage over a range of areas in each bay. In the extreme case of total suitable habitat coverage, oysters in Jamaica Bay could extract a total of similar to 61% of nitrogen input, and 47% if 5,000 acres were covered; whereas impressive, the oysters could not be sold for food and the cost of such a plan would be prohibitive. In Great South Bay, aquaculture covering 5,000 acres would take up 148% of the nitrogen input, which is encouraging because aquaculture leases are beginning to be awarded in this bay and most waters are clean enough for harvest and human consumption. The results suggest that an aquaculture-based oyster fishery might compensate for the nonpoint source nitrogen input that is common in many estuaries where nitrogen input is moderate and sewer systems are not present.","2015-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"573-583",NA,"2","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000360410500042",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the breadth of environmental benefits oysters provide, as well as their commercial and cultural importance, sustainable oyster production has become a priority in several regions, including the Chesapeake Bay. Current strategies include treating restored reefs as permanent sanctuaries, which provide long-term environmental benefits yet removes them from the fishery, or harvesting reefs on a rotational basis, which provides economic value yet decreases environmental benefits. The long term dynamics of these strategies is unknown. Oysters have a complex, biphasic life cycle (i.e., sessile adult and motile larval stages) and their viability is intimately tied to a suite of environmental factors including, but not limited to, flow regime, total suspended solids, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. In order to determine how different oyster management strategies affect oyster dynamics, we developed a multi-model approach that integrates a 2-D hydrodynamic model, a larval transport model, and a spatially-explicit, agent-based population dynamics model to simulate long term oyster dynamics. We applied our model to a ten reef system in the Great Wicomico River in the Chesapeake Bay, and simulated six different combinations of sanctuary and/or harvest management scenarios over an 8-year period. We evaluated the environmental and commercial benefits of each strategy. Our results indicated that sanctuary reefs are beneficial, and that the spatial position of sanctuary reefs strongly affected source-sink dynamics and must be considered before implementing a harvest regime. Simulations that did not consider the source/sink dynamics of the reefs yielded larger numbers of oysters for harvest in the short-term, yet resulted in a complete fishery collapse in the long term. Selective, rotational harvest, resulted in lower annual yield, but the fishery persisted throughout the eight year simulation. This integrated modeling approach helped reduce uncertainty within the study system and can help natural resource managers understand ecosystem-level processes leading to more informed decision making across spatial and temporal scales.

Oysters were out planted on twenty four oyster reef modules (80 cm above sea bed) and compared with oysters held on the sea bed close to each reef module to test the hypothesis that a reef habitat enhanced physiological performance. Filtration and respiration rates, condition index, haemolymph protein concentration, haemocyte counts and gonad maturation were measured as indicators of physiological performance. During the first 15 months of oyster reef deployment, water samples were collected at regular intervals at the sea bed and at a height of 80 cm from the sea bed to determine chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and bacterial abundance. Total suspended solids were significantly higher at the sea bed than at 80 cm above the sea bed at every sampling interval, while bacterial abundance adjacent to the sea bed was significantly higher than 80 cm above the sea bed in August and November 2013 when temperature was 18 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of 'reef oysters' (oysters on elevated reefs) were significantly higher than 'sea bed oysters' (oysters held on the sea bed). Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. As current stocks of European flat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe.

To understand how N removal may change with ontogeny, we compared N in tissue, shell, and biodeposits between juvenile and adult oysters. Juvenile oysters assimilated 165 +/- 8 mg (+/- SE) N oyster(-1) into soft tissues and shell, while adult oysters lost mass and returned N to the estuary (-48 +/- 21 mg N oyster(-1)). The percentage of N in soft tissues (11.80 +/- 0.01) did not differ between age classes but was significantly higher than measured elsewhere. The percentage of N in shell averaged 0.46 +/- 0.01 and 0.26 +/- 0.01 in juveniles and adults, respectively, accounting for >= 50% of total N in oysters. N released in biodeposits was estimated at 0.21 +/- 0.00 to 0.23 +/- 0.00 mg N oyster(-1) d(-1) and did not differ between age classes. Accurate quantification of N removal by oysters, therefore, should account for age and location-specific variation by including direct measurements of N assimilated into tissues and shell, released in biodeposits, and removed by biogeochemical processes. Continuous N sequestration and removal from local waters for bioremediation may require balancing recruitment or planting of young actively growing oysters with harvest of larger animals to ensure net N removal by assimilation before growth declines. This strategy may be particularly useful where environmental conditions do not support significant N removal through biogeochemical processes.","5/28/15","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"205-220",NA,"","528",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000356075600015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reef persistence relies on reef growth, which must outpace reef degradation and sediment deposition. The quantitative impact of burial on oyster survival and sublethal effects of sediment deposition are undefined. In this mesocosm study, we quantified effects of partial and complete burial (0, 50, 70, 90, and 110% of oyster shell height) on survival, biodeposition, condition index and growth of oysters (shell height = 25-75 mm). Survival only declined significantly when 90% or more of an oyster was buried; the critical burial depth inducing 50% mortality was 108%. This finding will allow scaling of mortality rates of oysters as a function of sediment load and oyster size. Biodeposition and condition index were negatively related to burial depth, whereas shell growth increased with burial depth. Decreases in biodeposition and condition index were likely related to disruption of feeding by burial and reallocation of energy resources to shell growth. The increase in shell growth was analogous to vertical migration of infaunal species-buried oysters increased vertical shell growth to breach the sediment surface to feed and respire, at the expense of tissue growth. While oysters are tolerant of partial burial in terms of survival, burial adversely affects metabolic processes that influence demographic rates and reef persistence. Future management efforts should consider the effects of partial burial, which often occur more frequently than catastrophic burial events causing mass mortality.","5/7/15","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"105-117",NA,"","527",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000354395700008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All reefs were located within Sister Lake, LA. Reefs were placed in pairs at 3 different locations within the lake; pairs were placed in low and medium energy sites within each location. Restored reefs placed within close proximity (<8 km) experienced very different development trajectories; there was high inter-site and inter-annual variation in recruitment and mortality of oysters, with only slight variation in growth curves. Despite this high variation in population dynamics, all reefs supported dense oyster populations (728 +/- 102 ind. m(-2)) and high live oyster biomass (>14.6 kg m(-2)) at the end of 3 yr.

We examined field patterns of diel-cycling hypoxia and used field and laboratory experiments to test its effects on acquisition and progression of Perkinsus marinus infections in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, as well as on oyster growth and filtration. P. marinus infections cause the disease known as Dermo, have been responsible for declines in oyster populations, and have limited success of oyster restoration efforts. The severity of diel-cycling hypoxia varied among shallow monitored sites in Chesapeake Bay, and average daily minimum dissolved oxygen was positively correlated with average daily minimum pH. In both field and laboratory experiments, diel-cycling hypoxia increased acquisition and progression of infections, with stronger results found for younger (1-year-old) than older (2-3-year-old) oysters, and more pronounced effects on both infections and growth found in the field than in the laboratory. Filtration by oysters was reduced during brief periods of exposure to severe hypoxia. This should have reduced exposure to waterborne P. marinus, and contributed to the negative relationship found between hypoxia frequency and oyster growth. Negative effects of hypoxia on the host immune response is, therefore, the likely mechanism leading to elevated infections in oysters exposed to hypoxia relative to control treatments. Because there is considerable spatial variation in the frequency and severity of hypoxia, diel-cycling hypoxia may contribute to landscape-level spatial variation in disease dynamics within and among estuarine systems.","2/11/15","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0116223",NA,"2","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000349545300018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Landscape scale agricultural and urban modifications require flood control which sometimes results in the release of excess freshwater that potentially damages estuarine ecology. The Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) is a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District focused on restoring natural patterns of freshwater flow to the Everglades and associated estuaries. One of the primary project goals is to reduce deleterious inflows eastward to the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) and westward to the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) by diverting freshwater south from Lake Okeechobee. Performance evaluation of the CEPP relies upon integrated modeling which links the watershed engineering projects to estuarine salinities and biotic responses. The objective of this study was to utilize seagrass and oyster models to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative inflow scenarios. There are three different scenarios: the existing condition base (ECB), the future without proposed CEPP projects (FWO) but with other landscape features that could alter freshwater inflows, and alternative 4R (ALT4R) that incorporates a suite of restoration projects including those associated with the CEPP. Each of these inflow scenarios was used to generate daily salinity time series from 1965 to 2005 at multiple locations in the SLE and CRE which were used to run site-specific seagrass and oyster models. The hydrodynamic and ecological effects of freshwater inflow were greater in the SLE compared to the much larger CRE. Predicted densities of oysters (individuals m(-2)) and seagrass (shoots m(-2)) were greater in the wet season (May-Oct) vs. the dry season (Nov-Apr) in both estuaries. Oyster and seagrass densities increased under the ALT4R inflow scenario that mitigated high inflows to the estuaries in the wet season. This result improved environmental conditions while increasing freshwater availability for other parts of the Greater Everglades and the southern estuaries such as Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay.

Here, the filtration rate equations for three existing models (Cerco and Noel, 2005; Fulford et al., 2007; Powell et al., 1992) are reviewed. We examine how each of the models define the maximum filtration rate and explore the various limitation factors that modify these maximum rates via environmental conditions that include salinity, temperature, and total suspended solids. Based on the individual model strengths assessed with a model comparison and literature review, we determine a maximum filtration rate of 0.17 (+/- 0.07)m(3) g(-1) DW day(-1) for a 1 g DW oyster to describe this rate process, which is then modified by a combination of limitation factors taken from a variety of sources.

Our case study is the collapse of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA, and the associated impacts on local resource dependent communities. The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series of environmental stressors to this region, which have included hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental, e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors. The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery, water, and petroleum resources. Successful restoration and persistence of a viable oyster fishery will depend on: (1) implementation of some minimal best management practices, e.g., extensive habitat restoration via shell addition, and some spatial closures to harvest, (2) improving environmental knowledge and promoting episodic learning through enhanced monitoring and experimental management, and (3) continued community engagement necessary to produce adaptable governance suitable to responding to future unexpected challenges.","2015","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"45",NA,"3","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000362913100037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Concurrent with the decline in oyster density was an increase in the prevalence of boring sponges (Cliona) on oysters and the underlying reef substrate material at these sites. The limestone marl substrate used to build these reefs became colonized by boring sponge to the degree that bioerosion by sponge potentially compromised the suitability of the reefs for oysters. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine whether oyster demographic rates of settlement, recruitment, growth, and mortality were affected by the presence of Cliona on underlying shell substrate. Oyster settlement on shells with varying levels of sponge was measured in the laboratory, and oyster recruitment, growth, and mortality in the presence and absence of sponge were measured in 2 estuaries in coastal North Carolina from 2011 to 2012. Potential alternative substrates for future reef restoration were tested in the field to determine their susceptibility to bioerosion by sponges. Substrates included 2 composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3; oyster shells and limestone marl) and 2 non-CaCO3 substrates (concrete and granite), because bioerosion by clionids target CaCO3. Surprisingly, no differences in oyster settlement, recruitment, growth, or mortality in the presence versus absence of Cliona were observed, suggesting that effects of the presence of sponge on oysters are either chronic rather than acute or are indirect and must act in concert with other oyster enemies. Notable patterns of sponge growth on the alternate substrates emerged; oyster shells were most susceptible to sponge growth, followed by marl, whereas concrete and granite were not susceptible to colonization by Cliona. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of having a strong understanding of the specific restoration methodology to be implemented, because the susceptibility of a substrate to bioerosion could have serious implications for reef longevity. Evidence is presented that consideration of the broader estuarine environment, including both biotic and abiotic factors, is vital when planning restoration actions, because the presence of Cliona was less important than the estuarine salinity gradient in altering oyster demographic rates and may shift the trajectories of restored reefs.","2014-11","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"727-738",NA,"3","33",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000346131900007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We recorded nearly an order-of-magnitude higher oyster settlement on the deepest (subtidal) reefs, but within a year abundance patterns reversed, and oyster densities were ultimately highest on the shallowest (intertidal) reefs by over an order-of-magnitude. 4. This reversal was due to (i) significantly elevated survivorship on intertidal reefs and (ii) larger surviving oysters on intertidal reefs. These patterns are likely to have developed from greater levels of biofouling and predator abundance (e.g. stone crabs, gastropods) on deeper reefs where aerial exposure was <5% of the monthly tidal cycle. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of restoration initiatives involving habitat-forming species can be enhanced by accounting for the biotic interactions that regulate population fitness. In littoral systems, vertical gradients in predation, competition and disturbance can be exploited to guide restoration of vegetated (e.g. mangrove, seagrass) or biogenic reef habitats. In particular, our results demonstrate that paradigms of vertical zonation learned from the rocky intertidal and saltmarshes also describe the fate of restored shellfish reefs. As with rocky shores, the lower vertical limit of adult oyster distribution in our study system was most likely driven by predatory and competitive (i.e. smothering) interactions, with a threshold depth at c. 5% daily aerial exposure. Below this depth, experimentally restored reefs failed completely. As with Spartina saltmarsh, accumulation of oyster biomass was greatest at an intermediate vertical position relative to mean sea level (i.e. mid-to-low intertidal).

This Case Study tested adult Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) from locations that supported comparable short-term survival rates by evaluating growth and tissue health and/or disease. Biomarkers indicated oyster tissues at one site were normal, the female:male sex ratio was 50:50, and female oysters were in spawning condition. Conversely, oyster tissues at the second site exhibited multiple abnormalities, samples were 100% male, and the incidence of disease was high. Using the biomarker tool, we evaluated 4 additional sites where oysters exhibited short-term (1 year) survival. At 2 locations, we observed chronic health impacts that would preclude reintroduction, including samples from one site where a wild population was surviving. We also analyzed tissue and shell heavy metal contents. Soft tissue metal concentrations in Meadowlands samples were at the high range of scientific literature values, averaging 1.1% of total body weight, whereas tissue metal concentrations at the Keyport site were within acceptable ranges. Although initial survival and growth rates at both locations were comparable, site-specific urban stressors reduced oyster fitness at 1 of the 2 locations. We are proposing an Estuarine Reintroduction Site Selection Model, which includes a biological in situ parameter, to increase the probability of successfully managing a sustainable oyster reintroduction before commencing expensive large-scale restoration activities.

The population dynamics often display extreme natural interannual variation in numbers and biomass, and oysters create their own habitat-the reef itself. With the worldwide decline of oyster reef habitat and the oyster fisheries dependent thereon, the maintenance of shell has received renewed attention as essential to population sustainability. We apply a shell budget model to estimate the sustainable catch of oysters on public oyster grounds in Louisiana using no net shell loss as a sustainability reference point. Oyster density and size are obtained from an annual stock assessment. The model simulates oyster growth and mortality, and natural shell loss. Shell mass is increased when oysters die in place, and is diminished when oysters are removed by fishing. The shell budget model has practical applications, such as identifying areas for closure, determining total allowable catch, managing shell planting and reef restoration, and achieving product certification for sustainability.

Eastern oyster reefs provide several ecosystem services, including water filtration, habitat diversity, and storm surge protection, among others. Oyster abundance has declined precipitously during the past century along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as a result of overfishing, disease and predation, and large-scale human-mediated events. Given the importance of oysters, both ecologically and economically, there have been significant efforts during the past 20 y to reestablish and/or restore oysters to historical levels. Successful reef restoration depends on choosing sites that optimize survival, which requires an understanding of the environmental factors that influence the life stage of an oyster. For most restoration projects, time and budget constraints prevent long-term field studies; therefore, modeling is often used to determine the best locations for restoration. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit, flexible, 4-parameter habitat suitability index model that can be used to determine locations suitable for restoration of eastern oyster reefs throughout the western Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The model captures the minimum environmental parameters required for successful restoration suitability and was applied in 2 studies: (1) Chesapeake Bay, a data rich environment, and (2) northern Gulf of Mexico (western Mississippi Sound), a data poor environment. It illustrates the implications of using data of varying quality when applying the model for identifying restoration potential. In both locations, the model was most sensitive to the presence of appropriate substrate, but not as sensitive to salinity values. This model provides a scientifically based support tool for natural resource managers and project planners, and local conditions may require further consideration.","2014-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"395-408",NA,"2","33",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000342693800007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, estimates of ecosystem services provided by a single species may vastly under-represent true provisioning, as we demonstrate here with an example of oyster reefs, often restored to improve estuarine water quality. In the brackish Chesapeake Bay, the hooked mussel Ischadium recurvum can have greater abundance and biomass than the focal restoration species, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. We measured the temperature-dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2-fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5-3 mu m), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer. When mussel and oyster filtration are accounted for in this, albeit simplistic, model, restoration of oyster reefs in a tributary scale restoration is predicted to control 100% of phytoplankton during the summer months.","2014-07","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"517-524",NA,"4","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000339662400012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Corpus Christi Bay, TX, USA, eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are limited to intertidal habitats, while in adjacent estuaries, oysters not only grow subtidally, but thrive in these areas to the extent they are a viable commercial fishery. The purpose of this study was to assess how predators and abiotic conditions affect oyster mortality and growth at different tidal elevations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that abiotic conditions, primarily hypoxia and salinity, as well as oyster disease, limits oysters to intertidal areas. Yet, in Corpus Christi Bay, oysters are absent from subtidal areas where hypoxia is not known to occur. Infection by Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) is common in the study area, but previous work suggests that infection rates do not increase when oysters are transplanted subtidally. We investigated oyster tidal distributions by transplanting newly settled oysters into intertidal and subtidal areas. Predation on oysters was significantly greater in subtidal as compared to intertidal habitats. When protected from predators using cages, oyster survival significantly increased. Further, oysters in subtidal areas allocated significantly more resources to shell growth than did those in intertidal areas, and oysters are known to grow heavier shells in response to predators. Oyster settlement was not statistically different between inter and subtidal areas, and abiotic conditions measured during the study did not exceed known tolerance limits for oysters. Previous studies have shown that abiotic conditions influence oyster mortality and the success of restored oyster reefs. Our findings indicate that predators can also affect oyster distribution, and their effects should be evaluated when developing plans for oyster management and restoration.","2014-07","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1557-1564",NA,"7","161",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000338285300008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The composition and porosity of marl may make it vulnerable to infestation by carbonate bioeroders, particularly clionid sponges.

There were no differences in oyster density among substrate types through the first 6 mo of reef sampling, although at 12 mo after reef construction, differences in density among substrates had emerged. Sites in high-salinity areas had much greater oyster recruitment than up-estuary, lower salinity locations. Early-life growth (<6 mo) of oysters was assessed for recruits to experimental reefs, with few differences seen in oyster mean valve length or growth rate on different substrate types. These results support consideration of non-CaCO3 materials, particularly concrete, for future oyster reef restoration, especially in high-salinity areas where the boring sponge Cliona is abundant, because both oyster density and growth were similar on oyster shell and concrete substrates as long as 1 y after reef construction.","2014-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"177-185",NA,"1","33",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000342693300017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Interest in their restoration has motivated research into oyster-mediated ecosystem services including effects on biodiversity, filtration, and nitrogen (N) cycling. Recent evidence suggests oysters may promote denitrification, or anaerobic respiration of nitrate (NO3-) into di-nitrogen gas, via benthic deposition of carbon (C) and N-rich biodeposits. However, the mechanisms whereby biodeposits promote N transformations prerequisite to denitrification (e.g., mineralization and nitrification) are unclear. Previous research has also not measured oysters' influence on N cycling in urbanized areas. In May 2010 we deployed eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in mesh cages above sand-filled boxes at four sites across a nutrient gradient in Jamaica Bay, New York City (New York, USA). Oysters were arranged at four densities: 0, 40, 85, and 150 oysters/m(2). For 17 months we measured water-column nutrients and chlorophyll a, every two weeks to monthly. Every two months we measured sediment ash-free dry mass (AFDM), exchangeable ammonium (NH4+), ammonification, nitrification, denitrification potential (DNP), and NO3- and C limitation of DNP. Oysters increased sediment AFDM at three of four sites, with the greatest increase at high density. Oysters did not affect any N pools or transformations. However, variation among sites and dates illustrated environmental drivers of C and N biogeochemistry in this urban estuary. Overall, nitrification was positively related to net ammonification, water column NH4+, and sediment NH4+, but was not correlated with DNP. Denitrification was consistently and strongly NO3- limited, while C was not limiting or secondarily limiting. Therefore, the oyster-mediated increase in AFDM did not affect DNP because C was not its primary driver. Also, because DNP was unrelated to nitrification, it is unlikely that biodeposit N was converted to NO3- for use as a denitrification substrate. Predicting times or sites where denitrification is driven by the C and N species originating from oyster biodeposits remains a challenge under eutrophic conditions. Towards this goal, we synthesized our conclusions with literature predictions in a conceptual model for pathways whereby oysters might influence C and N dynamics differently in oligotrophic relative to eutrophic ecosystems.","2014-03","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"271-286",NA,"2","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000331405700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 created a new pass, called Katrina Cut, halving Dauphin Island in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Significant decline in oyster population at Cedar Point Reef, the primary oyster harvest grounds in Mobile Bay, had persisted since then until the Cut was artificially closed in 2010. A bio-physical model for hydrodynamics and oyster larval transport was used to evaluate two potential mechanisms responsible for oyster population declines: salinity changes in the context of oyster habitat suitability and retention of oyster larvae. The model results revealed that when open Katrina Cut increased salinity at Cedar Point Reef. During high freshwater discharge, in particular, water exchange through Katrina Cut increased the bottom salinity from <5 psu to well over 15 (sometimes >20) psu during the tropic tides. Elevated salinities are associated with greater predation on oysters and higher disease incidence. The presence of the Katrina Cut also reduced larval retention in the spawning area regardless of tidal or river discharge conditions. We conclude that closing the Cut likely improved conditions for oysters within Mobile Bay and eastern Mississippi Sound and that these improved conditions have contributed to increased oyster landings.

Maximizing restoration benefits and increasing efficiency of shellfish restoration activities would greatly benefit from understanding and measurement of system responses to management activities. This project (1) compiles a database of northern Gulf of Mexico inshore artificial oyster reefs created for restoration purposes, and (2) quantitatively assesses a subset of reefs to determine project outcomes. We documented 259 artificial inshore reefs created for ecological restoration. Information on reef material, reef design and monitoring was located for 94, 43 and 20% of the reefs identified. To quantify restoration success, we used diver surveys to quantitatively sample oyster density and substrate volume of 11 created reefs across the coast (7 with rock; 4 with shell), paired with 7 historic reefs. Reefs were defined as fully successful if there were live oysters, and partially successful if there was hard substrate. Of these created reefs, 73% were fully successful, while 82% were partially successful. These data highlight that critical information related to reef design, cost, and success remain difficult to find and are generally inaccessible or lost, ultimately hindering efforts to maximize restoration success rates.

We established an ecological baseline using a combination of live, dead, archaeological, and fossil material to investigate the impacts of these stressors on the molluscan community. We expected that ecological change would increase with eutrophication-hypoxia west towards New York City. Instead we found that taxonomic similarity, rank-order abundance, and drilling frequency are more strongly controlled by commercial fishing pressure than by decreasing dissolved oxygen. Commercial fisherman collecting quahog clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), physically disrupt surface-dwelling organisms and also kill large numbers of predatory gastropods, including the channeled whelk, Busycotypus canaliculatus, and the drilling moonsnails Neverita duplicata and Euspira heros, to protect hard clam stocks. As a result, areas dredged by commercial fishermen yield fewer shells with drill-holes and fewer surface-dwelling organisms than unfished sites. In spite of recent reductions in lobster fishing, crushing predation by crabs and lobsters on clams has been suppressed below baseline levels throughout US, even in the well oxygenated east. The absence of a clear relationship between eutrophication-hypoxia and ecological change questions the effectiveness of nitrogen reduction alone as a restoration strategy. LIS fossils revealed a relatively ancient loss of those mollusks associated with seagrass and oyster habitats (e.g., oysters, Crassostrea virginica; jingle shells, Anomia simplex; scallops, Argopecten irradiens; and the gastropod Bittiolum alternatum) that predates the accumulation of dead shells and underscores the need for older material to reveal the shifting baseline. The interactive nature of multiple stressors means that past overfishing may have dampened the response of communities in LIS to eutrophication or inhibited their capactiy to recover. The unexpected role of hypoxic areas protected from commercial fishing as refuges highlights the utility of no-take marine preserves in eutrophied estuaries worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Management activities, including efforts to enhance larval settlement, to rebuild the Chesapeake Bay eastern oyster population have met with limited success. Since 1939, juvenile oyster abundance has been measured at oyster bars in the northern portion of Chesapeake Bay. Prior analyses of those data indicate that juvenile oyster abundance is influenced by environmental conditions, which are related to regional climate. We quantified a regional scale (1,000km(2)) climate signal using a synoptic climatology approach by identifying predominant weather patterns. We related these weather patterns to Susquehanna River freshwater discharge, a major influencing factor on Chesapeake Bay salinity, and the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), an indicator of the overall wetness or dryness of a given region. We developed path analysis models that linked weather patterns to Susquehanna River discharge and thence to either the PHDI or ambient salinity and water temperature and finally to juvenile oyster abundance in one of four preidentified spatial groupings. The path models indicated that weather patterns that produce wet conditions, leading to a higher PHDI and lower salinity, resulted in reduced juvenile oyster abundance; weather patterns that produce dry conditions that decreased the PHDI and increased salinity resulted in higher juvenile oyster abundance. Our results indicate that regions of higher juvenile oyster abundance may be predicted several months in advance using the path model. These predictions can be used to increase the effectiveness of oyster restoration efforts by indicating where hard substrate added to oyster bars in the four regions is likely to result in greater than average numbers of juvenile oysters.

In estuaries, a decline of overall habitat quality and functioning has led to significant efforts to restore critical ecosystem services, recently through the creation and restoration of oyster reefs. Oyster reef restoration generally occurs with goals of (1) increasing water quality via filtration through sustainable oyster recruitment, (2) stabilizing shorelines, and (3) creating and enhancing critical estuarine habitat for fish and invertebrates. We restored over 260 m(2) of oyster reef habitat in coastal Louisiana and followed the development and provision of these ecosystem services from 2009 through 2012. Oysters recruited to reefs immediately, with densities of oysters greater than 75 mm exceeding 80 ind m(-2) after 3 years, and provision of filtration rates of 1002 perpendicular to 187 L h(-1) m(-2); shoreline stabilization effects of the created reefs were minimal over the three years of monitoring, with some evidence of positive shoreline stabilization during higher wind/energy events only; increased nekton abundance of resident, but not larger transient fish was immediately measurable at the reefs, however, this failed to increase through time. Our results provide critical insights into the development trajectories of ecosystem services provided by restored oyster reefs, as well as the mechanisms mediating these changes.

Historically, societal demand for oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest, which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives. Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for exploited ecosystem engineers.","2014","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"38",NA,"3","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000343247200046",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), oysters living on prop roots and in isolated clumps on the ground (ground oysters) near mangroves comprise most of the natural population. Overall mean and median densities on prop roots were 750 and 177.8 live oysters m(-2) but only similar to 20 live oysters m(-2) in ground oysters. We collected data on C. virginica abundance and size, mangrove habitat, and physical and geographical variables ( fetch, sediment firmness, distances from inlet and nearest freshwater discharge source) and obtained water quality data (salinity, chlorophyll a, turbidity) from long-term monitoring databases. Data were analyzed using structural equation models (SEM), and we chose the best models by Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Oyster abundance (R-2=0.74) and size (R-2=0.60) on prop roots were functions of mangrove habitat, salinity, sediment, and distance to freshwater discharges. Fetch and distance to inlet affected sediment and thus had indirect effects on oysters. Inlet distance also affected the 5 yr coefficient of variation of salinity. In a separate SEM, the abundance of ground oysters near mangroves was a strong, positive effect on oysters on prop roots, in part because prop root oysters can break off and seed oyster clumps to the ground. However, ground oysters were directly negatively affected by fetch and distance to inlet, which had no direct effects on oysters living on prop roots. Red mangroves facilitate oysters by providing protection from sedimentation and offering a stable refuge during storms. However, increasing numbers of mangroves near a site had negative effects on oysters on the ground, possibly because it provided an enhanced habitat for predators.","2014","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"177-194",NA,"","503",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000335581700012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we present experiments that comprehensively examined how the ocean's past, present and projected (21st and 22nd centuries) CO2 concentrations impact the growth and physiology of larval stages of C. virginica. Crassostrea virginica larvae grown in present-day pCO(2) concentrations (380 MU atm) displayed higher growth and survival than individuals grown at both lower (250 mu atm) and higher pCO(2) levels (750 and 1500 mu atm). Crassostrea virginica larvae manifested calcification rates, sizes, shell thicknesses, metamorphosis, RNA: DNA ratios and lipid contents that paralleled trends in survival, with maximal values for larvae grown at 380 mu atm pCO(2) and reduced performance in higher and lower pCO(2) levels. While some physiological differences among oysters could be attributed to CO2-induced changes in size or calcification rates, the RNA: DNA ratios at ambient pCO(2) levels were elevated, independent of these factors. Likewise, the lipid contents of individuals exposed to high pCO(2) levels were depressed even when differences in calcification rates were considered. These findings reveal the cascading, interdependent impact that high CO2 can have on oyster physiology. Crassostrea virginica larvae are significantly more resistant to elevated pCO(2) than other North Atlantic bivalves, such as Mercenaria mercenaria and Argopecten irradians, a finding that may be related to the biogeography and/or evolutionary history of these species and may have important implications for future bivalve restoration and aquaculture efforts.","2014","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"cou004",NA,"1","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000209703800025",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An oyster habitat suitability index model is presented that evaluates the effects of a proposed sediment and freshwater diversion into Lower Breton Sound. Voluminous freshwater, needed to suspend and broadly distribute river sediment, will push optimal salinities for oysters seaward and beyond many of the existing reefs. Implementation and operation of the Lower Breton Sound diversion structure as proposed would render about 6,173 ha of hard bottom immediately east of the Mississippi River unsuitable for the sustained cultivation of oysters. If historical harvests are to be maintained in this region, a massive and unprecedented effort to relocate private leases and restore oyster bottoms would be required.

Study locations included Tampa Bay, Mosquito Lagoon, Sebastian River, St. Lucie estuary (3 study sites), Loxahatchee River (2 study sites), Lake Worth Lagoon, and Biscayne Bay. Settled oyster density was monitored twice per year at stations within each study site. Oyster recruitment, water temperature, and salinity were monitored on a monthly basis. Salinity varied greatly among the estuaries, and each study site fell into 1 of 2 primary salinity regimes: one relatively stable and with higher salinities (mean range, 24-35), and the other more variable and with lower salinities (mean range, 12-17). All 7 estuaries were impacted, to varying degrees, by the relatively active 2005 tropical storm season as well as local water management practices during the study. Two of the estuaries, St. Lucie and the Sebastian River, were severely impacted by controlled introductions of freshwater, which decreased salinities below the range that oysters can tolerate. As a result, live oysters were virtually absent from the study sites in both estuaries in 2005, when the freshwater introductions were most pronounced. At the opposite extreme, long-term reduction of freshwater flow into Biscayne Bay has exacerbated already increasing salinities and has resulted in the absence of reef-building oysters at that study site. Oysters were present at all other study sites, but densities were lower in 2005 than in subsequent years because of substantial salinity decreases after tropical storms in 2004 and 2005. The greatest and most stable oyster densities were found in Tampa Bay, where mean oyster density reached 400/m(2) by fall 2007. Recruitment was observed at each site on recruitment arrays retrieved from April through December, although the timing, duration, and intensity of the recruitment season varied annually and among study sites. The Tampa Bay, Mosquito Lagoon, Loxahatchee River, and Lake Worth Lagoon sites exhibited a bimodal recruitment pattern with peaks in the spring and fall. At the remaining sites, which were the most strongly affected by water management practices, recruitment patterns were sporadic and inconsistent throughout the study. The lowest recruitment rates occurred in 2005, when the density of settled oysters was also low, presumably because of reduced salinities resulting from a combination of active tropical storm seasons and controlled freshwater introductions.","2013-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"695-708",NA,"3","32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000331554700011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We adapted a commercial adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) content-based assay to assess the in vitro proliferation of P. marinus in a 96-well plate format, and validated the method by measuring the effects of potential anti-proliferative compounds. The sensitivity (1.5-3.1 x 10(4) cells/well), linearity (R-2 = 0.983), and signal stability (60 min) support the reliability of the assay for assessing cell proliferation. Validation of the assay by culturing P. marinus in the presence of increasing concentrations of triclosan showed a dose-response profile. The IC50 value obtained was higher than that reported earlier, possibly due to the use of different viability assay methods and a different P. marinus strain. The antibiotics G418 and tetracycline and the herbicide fluridone were active against P. marinus proliferation; the IC50 of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and atrazine was relatively high suggesting either off-target effects or inability to reach the targets.

This may explain why subtidal oyster reefs declined after major flood events in the late nineteenth century, associated with infestations by spionid polychaete mudworms. Today, mortalities of S. glomerata in the region are associated with QX disease caused by Marteilia sydneyi. Increased virulence of M. sydneyi is likely due to a combination of increased abundance of intermediate hosts in habitat utilised by oysters, together with immunosuppression of the oysters. These processes are all driven by declining water quality derived from anthropogenic catchment development.

Eutrophication seemed to impact shellfish through changes in the quality of food and not the quantity since the growth rates of shellfish were more often correlated with densities of specific cell types or quality of seston rather than bulk measures of phytoplankton and organic seston. Northern quahogs and eastern oysters grew maximally within eutrophic locales, and their growth was positively correlated with high densities of autotrophic nanoflagellates and centric diatoms in these regions (p < 0.001). The growth rates of northern quahogs were also positively correlated with relative water motion, suggesting an important role for tidal currents in delivering seston to suspension feeders. Bay scallops and slipper limpets were negatively impacted by eutrophication, growing at the slowest rate at the most eutrophic sites. Furthermore, bay scallop growth was negatively correlated with densities of dinoflagellates, which were more abundant at the most eutrophic site (p < 0.001). These results suggest that nutrient loading can have significant but complex effects on suspension-feeding molluscs with select species (e.g., oysters and clams) benefiting from eutrophication and other species performing poorly (e.g., scallops and slipper limpets). Future management approaches that seek to restore bivalve populations will need to account for the differential effects of nutrient loading as managers target species and regions to be restored.","2013-11","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1274-1291",NA,"6","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000325099900014",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sensitivity of oysters to variable discharge and salinity is particularly acute in small sub-tropical estuaries subject to regulated freshwater releases. South Florida has sub-tropical estuaries where watershed flood control sometimes results in excessive freshwater inflow to estuaries during the wet season (May-Oct) and reduced discharge and increased salinities in the dry season (Nov-Apr). The potential to reserve freshwater accumulated during the wet season could offer the capacity to regulate freshwater at different temporal scales, thus optimizing salinity conditions for estuarine biota. The goal of this study was to use simulation modeling to explore the effects of freshwater inflows and salinity on adult oyster survival in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) in southwest Florida. Water managers derived three different freshwater inflow scenarios for the CRE based on historical and modified watershed attributes for the time period of 1965-2000. Three different salinity time series were generated from the inflow scenarios at each of three sites in the lower CRE and used to conduct nine different oyster simulations. Overall, the predicted densities of adult oysters in the upstream site were 3-4 times greater in seasons that experienced reduced freshwater inflow (e.g., increased salinity) with oyster density in the lower estuary much less influenced by the inflows. Potential storage of freshwater reduced the frequency of extreme flows in the wet season and helped to maintain minimum inflow in the dry season near the estuarine mouth. Analyses of inflows indicated that discharges ranging from 0 to 1,500 cfs could promote favorable salinities of 10-25 in the lower CRE depending on wet versus dry season climatic conditions. This range of inflows is similar to that derived in other studies of the CRE and emphasizes the value of simulation models to help prescribe freshwater releases which benefit estuarine biota.","2013-10","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"981-994",NA,"4","52",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000324633900018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There have been few theoretical efforts to optimize the physical characteristics of a restored reef patch to achieve high recruitment rates. The delivery of competent larvae to a reef patch is influenced by larval behavior and by physical habitat characteristics such as substrate roughness, patch length, current speed, and water depth. We used a spatial model, the ""hitting-distance"" model, to identify habitat characteristics that will jointly maximize both the settlement probability and the density of recruits on an oyster reef (Crassostrea virginica). Modeled larval behaviors were based on laboratory observations and included turbulence-induced diving, turbulence-induced passive sinking, and neutral buoyancy. Profiles of currents and turbulence were based on velocity profiles measured in coastal Virginia over four different substrates: natural oyster reefs, mud, and deposited oyster and whelk shell. Settlement probabilities were higher on larger patches, whereas average settler densities were higher on smaller patches. Larvae settled most successfully and had the smallest optimal patch length when diving over rough substrates in shallow water. Water depth was the greatest source of variability, followed by larval behavior, substrate roughness, and tidal current speed. This result suggests that the best way to maximize settlement on restored reefs is to construct patches of optimal length for the water depth, whereas substrate type is less important than expected. Although physical patch characteristics are easy to measure, uncertainty about larval behavior remains an obstacle for predicting settlement patterns. The mechanistic approach presented here could be combined with a spatially explicit metapopulation model to optimize the arrangement of reef patches in an estuary or region for greater sustainability of restored habitats.","8/19/13","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e71506",NA,"8","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000323425700061",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patterns of growth, mortality, condition, and disease were compared with a clean-water site in Shelter Island, NY, sampled in parallel with both sampling phases. In both studies, oyster mortality in the urban sites increased dramatically during and after the second summer growth season. Mortality also increased at the same time period at the cleanwater site, but to a much smaller degree. One instance of high mortality in the Lower Hudson was caused by MSX; but, otherwise, no known diseases were identified as the main cause of the sudden mortality increases. Our results suggest that a general effect of reduced water quality had a cumulative effect on the New York Harbor-emplaced oysters, which culminated in high mortality, mainly at the end of the second summer growing season. Despite the increased mortality, other factors such as soft tissue growth and reproduction were not reduced in the harbor sites relative to the clean-water control site.

Because the effects of mussel communities on ecosystem processes result largely from their feeding behavior, we need to understand how they sample and process particulate matter. Our objective was to determine whether measuring a suite of biochemical markers in unionid mussels, from different populations of 2 species (Amblema plicata, Actinonaias ligamentina) across a broad geographical range (4 North American rivers), would help identify their primary dietary sources. Stable isotope data were able to differentiate mussels among rivers, and sometimes species. Data on delta N-15 revealed that mussels fed across trophic levels but that diet varied with habitat and perhaps species. Although mussels contained the same types of fatty acids regardless of river or species, we nonetheless observed considerable variation in essential fatty acid content across rivers. Essential fatty acid profiles were dominated consistently by arachidonic acid. Source-specific fatty acid biomarkers suggested that bacterial and detrital resources might be as important as algae in many habitats. In summary, biochemical metrics differed more among rivers than between species. This suggests that mussels are either considerably adaptable in their dietary requirements or that they feed nonselectively. Understanding nutritional profiles in mussels will help restore unionid communities, which may lead to the reestablishment of their critical role as nutrient recyclers in freshwater food webs.","2013-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"497-507",NA,"2","32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000331516100029",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oysters are of particular importance because of their capacity to modify coastal and estuarine habitats and the highly degraded status of their habitats worldwide. However, models to predict dynamics of ecosystem engineers have not previously included the effects of exploitation. We developed a linked population and habitat model for autogenic ecosystem engineers undergoing exploitation. We parameterized the model to represent eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in upper Chesapeake Bay by selecting sets of parameter values that matched observed rates of change in abundance and habitat. We used the model to evaluate the effects of a range of management and restoration options including sustainability of historical fishing pressure, effectiveness of a newly enacted sanctuary program, and relative performance of two restoration approaches. In general, autogenic ecosystem engineers are expected to be substantially less resilient to fishing than an equivalent species that does not rely on itself for habitat. Historical fishing mortality rates in upper Chesapeake Bay for oysters were above the levels that would lead to extirpation. Reductions in fishing or closure of the fishery were projected to lead to long-term increases in abundance and habitat. For fisheries to become sustainable outside of sanctuaries, a substantial larval subsidy would be required from oysters within sanctuaries. Restoration efforts using high-relief reefs were predicted to allow recovery within a shorter period of time than low-relief reefs. Models such as ours, that allow for feedbacks between population and habitat dynamics, can be effective tools for guiding management and restoration of autogenic ecosystem engineers.","2013-06","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"766-776",NA,"4","23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000320105100007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Following dramatic declines in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this species is now the focus of renewed restoration efforts. Restoration is undertaken for brood stock rehabilitation as well as a range of ecosystem services such as filtration; however, these ecosystem services are as yet poorly quantified. We present the first laboratory measurements of filtration rates (FR) for O. lurida, to which we fit a model of FR as a function of dry tissue weight and water temperature. We find that O. lurida has a FR at optimum temperature similar to previously established means across oyster species at 1 g dry tissue weight (DTW), but lower than many Crassostrea species. We also find that the allometric exponent relating FR to DTW in O. lurida is lower than the previously published mean across oyster species. Based on our derived filtration rates and historical data, we estimate the historic impact of filtration by O. lurida in five Pacific coast estuaries. We find that historic O. lurida populations did not have the capacity to filter the full volume of the estuary within the estuary residence time in any of the estuaries examined. This result is primarily driven by the low water temperatures and the short estuary residence times that typify the Pacific coast. We conclude that, unlike Crassostrea virginica Gmelin on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the Olympia oyster was not historically a dominant force in regulating seston concentrations at large scales in Pacific coast estuaries. Given the differences in the ecological role and habitat structure of these two oyster species, we recommend that analogies between them be drawn with caution.

We focused on the dispersal of larvae released from the commercially exploited (Cedar Point, CP) and non-exploited (Bon Secour Bay, BSB) oyster populations. We found that high flushing rates through the dominant inlet prevented larval exchange between the commercially exploited and non-exploited populations, resulting in negligible connectivity between them. Variations in tidal amplitude, river discharge and wind direction played a more important role in the amount of larvae retained in Mobile Bay when they are released from CP than from BSB. Under most of the scenarios, larvae from BSB were retained around the spawning area, while larvae from CP showed a predominant westward flow. Net sinking behavior of late-stage larvae increased larval retention in the bay, but physical transport showed a higher impact in the amount of larvae retained.

The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that translocated mussel clumps would increase habitat complexity thus accelerating community succession and enhancing natural recruitment of M. modiolus spat. These effects were predicted to be greater on elevated cultch due to greater protection from predators and increased accessibility to food resources. Within the artificial reef array the translocated clumps had a significant positive effect on recruitment compared to cultch without mussels with average densities of spat settled on the translocated M. modiolus clumps ranging from 100 to 200 individuals m(-2) compared to 4 to 52 spat m(-2) on cultch without mussels. Recruitment of M. modiolus spat was also significantly higher on translocated horse mussels when compared to natural reefs where densities of 8-36 spat m(-2) were recorded. Reef elevation appeared to provide some degree of protection from predators but differences in translocated M. modiolus survival on the different elevation treatments were not significant. In total, 223 taxa were recorded 12 months after reef construction. The presence of translocated clumps of M. modiolus was the main driver of the increases in faunal diversity and species abundance. Application of objective criteria to assess the performance of artificial reefs suggested that translocation of M. modiolus clumps alone achieved most of the restoration objectives. Consequently this pilot study demonstrates a straightforward and realistic intervention technique that could be used to kick start the regeneration and expansion of impacted mussel and similar biogenic reefs elsewhere.

In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, the horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) biogenic reefs cover only a fraction of their historical range with the remaining reefs badly damaged and requiring restoration. Previous experimental trials suggest that translocation of horse mussels accelerates reef recovery and has therefore been proposed as a suitable restoration technique. We used a series of coupled hydrodynamic and particle dispersal models to assess larval dispersion from remnant and translocated populations to identify suitable areas for adult live M. modiolus translocation in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. A maximum entropy model (MAXENT) was used to identify if dispersing larvae could reach habitat suitable for adult M. modiolus. From these we predicted if translocated mussels will reseed themselves or be able to act as larval sources for nearby reefs. The dispersal models showed that the remnant M. modiolus populations are largely self-recruiting with little connectivity between them. The majority of larvae settled near the sources and movement was largely dependent on the tides and not influenced by wind or waves. Higher reef elevation resulted in larvae being able to disperse further away from the release point. However, larval numbers away from the source population are likely to be too low for successful recruitment There was also little connectivity between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough as any larvae entering the Lough remained predominantly in the Strangford Narrows. The areas covered by these self-seeding populations are suitable for M. modiolus translocation according to the MAXENT model. As a result of this work and in conjunction with other field work we propose a combination of total protection of all remaining larval sources and small scale translocations onto suitable substrata in each of the identified self-recruiting areas.

Paleobiology, archeology, and history provide historical ecological context for biological conservation, remediation, and restoration. We argue that linking historical ecology explicitly with conservation can help unify related disciplines of conservation paleobiology, conservation archeobiology, and environmental history. Differences in the spatial and temporal resolution and extent (scale) of prehistoric, historic, and modern ecological data remain obstacles to integrating historical ecology and conservation biology, but the prolonged temporal extents of historical ecological data can help establish more complete baselines for restoration, document a historical range of ecological variability, and assist in determining desired future conditions. We used the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery of the Chesapeake Bay (U.S.A.) to demonstrate the utility of historical ecological data for elucidating oyster conservation and the need for an approach to conservation that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Historical ecological studies from the Chesapeake have documented dramatic declines (as much as 99%) in oyster abundance since the early to mid-1800s, changes in oyster size in response to different nutrient levels from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries, and substantial reductions in oyster accretion rates (from 10 mm/year to effectively 0 mm/year) from the Late Holocene to modern times. Better integration of different historical ecological data sets and increased collaboration between paleobiologists, geologists, archeologists, environmental historians, and ecologists to create standardized research designs and methodologies will help unify prehistoric, historic, and modern time perspectives on biological conservation.","2013-02","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"45-54",NA,"1","27",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000313781600006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For instance, in shallow marine ecosystems, reefs formed by filter-feeding bivalves such as oysters provide complex structure, while simultaneously influencing water column properties (e. g. light availability) through suspension feeding. Although it is well supported that both complex structure and light level can influence trophic interactions individually, both factors are highly variable in shallow marine ecosystems and potentially interact to produce non-additive effects. To explore how the multiple influences of an ecosystem engineer affect trophic interactions, we conducted mesocosm experiments with common estuarine species (i.e. Atlantic croaker and grass shrimp, and blue crab and brown shrimp) to test the effects of habitat context (high complexity oyster reefs vs. structureless bottom) and light level on prey survival. Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus predation on grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio was significantly reduced by the presence of oyster reef structure and was not affected by light level. In contrast, blue crab Callinectes sapidus predation on brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus was influenced by the interaction of habitat context and light level: the presence of oyster reefs reduced brown shrimp survival rates at high light levels, but increased survival in low light. Therefore, predicting how habitat context influences species interactions requires an understanding of both species composition and light level. The setting and the physical factors altered by ecosystem engineers can influence community structure both individually and collectively, and consequently should be incorporated in predictive models aimed at understanding and enhancing our management of coastal ecosystems.","2013","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"295-301",NA,"","491",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000325282500022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fluxes of O-2, NH4+, NO2+3 and SRP at the restored site were enhanced by at least one order of magnitude during all seasons. Seasonal denitrification rates at the restored site, measured as flux of N-2-N, ranged from 0.3 to 1.6 mmol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1), with August rates among the highest ever recorded for an aquatic system.

To reverse the current oyster reef declines, governmental and private organizations have invested substantial resources into oyster restoration. Restoration primarily consists of deploying hard substrate. If oyster recruitment is thought to be limited, hatchery-raised juvenile oysters are set on the hard substrate. These costly setting efforts are carried out despite limited information on whether seed oysters accelerate reef development and, if so, how oyster size and time of deployment maximize oyster survival. North Carolina, USA, has established subtidal oyster sanctuaries in Pamlico Sound using marl mounds and hatchery-raised juvenile oysters set on recycled shell. We experimentally manipulated marl mounds at 3 sanctuaries differing abiotically and biotically during summer 2010 and varied recycled shell and seed presence, seed size, and shell and seed deployment date. Although oyster settlement varied spatially, natural recruitment swamped any measurable effect of seeding. Our findings, in combination with information from 3 additional sanctuaries seeded in 2006 and 2008, indicate that seeding does not enhance oyster reef restoration efforts in Pamlico Sound. Financial resources used for oyster seed would be better used to increase the amount of substrate for oyster settlement. Although our results may not apply to areas with less natural oyster recruitment, our study highlights the need to quantify basic ecological processes on appropriate spatiotemporal scales to optimize restoration actions.

Limited studies from the Cape Lookout system implicate large schooling cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in the devastation of patches of commercially harvested bay scallop via strong density-dependent foraging behavior during migrations through this estuary. However, despite the extensive Atlantic range of R. bonasus, the pervasiveness of their patch-depleting foraging behavior and thus impact on shellfisheries remains unknown outside of North Carolina waters. To further understand the potential impacts of cownose rays on benthic prey and the role of bivalve density in eliciting these impacts, we conducted exclusion and manipulation experiments at two sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico frequented by rays during spring migrations. Despite a correlation in ray abundance with haustorid amphipod (primary natural prey) density at our study sites, we were unable to detect any effect of rays on amphipod densities. In addition, through manipulation of predator access, we determined the main cause of mortality to manipulated patches of hard clams was predation by smaller predators such as Callinectes sapidus and not cownose rays. While cownose rays consume hard clam in other parts of their range, we suggest rays along northern Gulf of Mexico barrier islands may prefer foraging on smaller and thinner-shelled bivalves (e.g., Donax sp.), as well as more abundant amphipod crustaceans. We caution that these preferences may have reduced our ability to detect effects of rays on manipulated prey, and thus future impact experiments should strongly consider the local diet of these predators and explore novel techniques to estimate effects on small crustaceans. Further synchronized experimentation along basin-wide scales may elucidate the environmental factors that determine the severity of cownose ray foraging impacts across their range.

We find that filtration capacity of oysters has declined almost universally (12 of the 13 estuaries examined) by a median of 85 %. Whereas historically, oyster populations achieved full estuary filtration (filtering a volume equivalent or larger than the entire estuary volume within the residence time of the water) in six of the eight estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico during summer months, this is now the case for only one estuary: Apalachicola Bay, Florida. By contrast, while all five estuaries on the North Atlantic coast showed large decreases in filtration capacity, none were achieving full estuary filtration at the time of our c. 1900 historic baseline. This apparent difference from the Gulf of Mexico is explained at least in part by our North Atlantic baseline representing a shifted baseline, as surveyed populations were already much reduced by exploitation in this region.","2013-01","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"36-43",NA,"1","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000312717400004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current study used a novel, non-destructive sampling approach involving the deployment of a drop net around study plots to compare the nektonic assemblages associated with intertidal oyster reefs (natural and enhanced) with those of neighboring soft sediment habitats at 3 sites in South Carolina. At each site, the nektonic organisms collected on a reef plot were compared with those collected on an adjacent control plot lacking a structurally complex habitat. Nekton abundance was significantly higher on the reef plot compared with the control plot at all 3 sites. Nekton abundance also varied among seasons, with the greatest numbers occurring during summer compared with spring and fall. Notably, grass shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.) were especially dominant on reef plots. A total of 60 taxa were identified, 57 of which were identified to species level. Reef plots exhibited significantly greater taxon richness than control plots. The number of taxa present also accumulated over time at a higher rate on the reef plots than on the control plots at 2 of the 3 sites. Among the 60 taxa collected, 36 were found on both the reef and control plots, whereas 14 taxa were unique to the reef plots. For data pooled across all sites and seasons, 33 taxa were more numerous on reef plots than control plots, 3 taxa occurred in equal numbers, and 24 taxa were more numerous on control plots. For taxa collected on more than 1 occasion, paired t-tests performed with Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds revealed that Alpheus heterochaelis and Palaemonetes spp. were significantly more abundant on the reef plots than on the control plots, whereas unadjusted analyses revealed the same pattern for Gobiosoma bosc, Menidia menidia, and Fundulus heteroclitus. In contrast, no taxa were significantly more abundant on the control plots at either significance threshold. Although nekton abundance was generally higher on the reef plots, measures of diversity were significantly higher on the control plots, regardless of season, site, or date. Greater abundance of a limited number of species on the reef plots accounted for lower evenness and therefore lower diversity measures for this treatment. Overall, community structure was driven more by site than by treatment, whereas the seasonal occurrences of certain species on the reef plots highlighted the importance of oyster reefs as essential fish habitat for the critical life stages of finfish species with complex life histories.","2012-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1009-1021",NA,"4","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000313389200013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since 1939, juvenile oyster abundance has been measured at sentinel oyster bars in the northern portion of Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. We conducted a cluster analysis on these data and detected 4 distinct spatial patterns. These patterns were related to juvenile oyster abundance (i.e., bars that experienced high overall juvenile abundance grouped together) and salinity. Of the sentinel bars sampled since the mid 1980s, our analysis identified 13 bars that were characterized by high juvenile oyster abundance and low variation among years, which makes them prime candidate bars for protection to aid in restoration. A comparison with bars already protected within oyster sanctuaries revealed some overlap (4 total bars in common); however, the 13 bars we identified were found over broader geographical and salinity ranges. Juvenile oyster abundance on this group of 13 prime bars was intercorrelated significantly, suggesting that interannual variability in juvenile oyster abundance affects each region similarly. Significant correlations between the juvenile oyster abundance time series and the Palmer hydrological drought index suggest that variations in wet/dry cycles are the cause of this interannual variability.

In general, per-capita fecundity was highest at more inland mesohaline reserves, whereas reproductive potential per square meter and reserve reproductive potential were highest at more seaward polyhaline reserves as a result of a combination of relatively high density, and large oyster size and reserve areas. All 3 reproductive metrics increased in general over time. These results suggest that inland broodstock reserves should be prioritized for stock enhancement/seeding and more seaward reserves for reserve expansion and highlight the need to consider spatiotemporal variation and the scale at which a key demographic rate (fecundity and reproductive potential) is expressed when assessing the efficacy and conservation/restoration targets of marine reserves.","2012-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1091-1101",NA,"4","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000313389200020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recruitby at least an order of magnitude. Within 7 yr, recruitment was similar between reef-bar pairs although both reefs and bars received additions of shell, live oysters, or both during the study period. At decadal time scales, constructed oyster reefs did not show enhanced recruitment relative to adjacent natural oyster bars. The rapid decline in reef recruitment post-construction is likely related to three processes: (i) shell degradation by taphonomic processes, (ii) biofouling that occludes the shell surface to recruitment, and (iii) inability of extant oysters on the reef to produce new shell at a rate commensurate with losses to (i) and (ii). There appears to be a requirement for continued replenishment activity to maintain the shell base on these reefs, contrary to the dynamics of a healthy natural oyster population. The similarity in recruitment between constructed reefs and natural bars at decadal time scales suggests that subtidal shell plants or shell additions to natural bars may be a more cost-effective repletion strategy because they provide equal population enhancement per unit area.","2012-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"627-646",NA,"4","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000312986100007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus, and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.","2012-11","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"789-798",NA,"3","170",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000309866200019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For successful and sustainable oyster reef restoration efforts, it is necessary to choose sites that support long-term growth and survival of oysters. Selection of suitable sites is critically important as it can greatly influence mortality factors and may largely determine the ultimate success of the restoration project. The application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provides an effective methodology for identifying suitable sites for oyster reef restoration and removes much of the uncertainty involved in the sometimes trial and error selection process. This approach also provides an objective and quantitative tool for planning future oyster reef restoration efforts. The aim of this study was to develop a restoration suitability index model and reef quality index model to characterize locations based on their potential for successful reef restoration within the Mission-Aransas Estuary, Texas, USA. The restoration suitability index model focuses on salinity, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and depth, while the reef quality index model focuses on abundance of live oysters, dead shell, and spat. Size-specific Perkinsus marinus infection levels were mapped to illustrate general disease trends. This application was effective in identifying suitable sites for oyster reef restoration, is flexible in its use, and provides a mechanism for considering alternative approaches. The end product is a practical decision-support tool that can be used by coastal resource managers to improve oyster restoration efforts. As oyster reef restoration activities continue at small and large-scales, site selection criteria are critical for assisting stakeholders and managers and for maximizing long-term sustainability of oyster resources.","7/11/12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e40839",NA,"7","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000306362400104",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster growth yielded 0.2-0.4 g N in tissues and depended on estuary-specific conditions. delta N-15 values confirmed that N in oyster tissues derived from local anthropogenic sources. At representative restoration and aquaculture conditions (<= 400 oysters.m(-2) at 0.5%-1.0% of estuary area), estimated N removal was <= 15% of land-derived loads and <1% of phytoplankton N.

However, because of improvements in water quality, the potential exists to reintroduce this ecologically extinct species to the ecosystem. For over a decade, New York/New Jersey Baykeeper has conducted oyster restoration activities in support of target ecological goals proposed in the HRE Comprehensive Restoration Plan (CRP). The critical research question is whether existing conditions at a proposed restoration site can actually support long-term Eastern Oyster survival. To determine the feasibility of restoring this native species in Keyport Harbor, New Jersey, juvenile oysters were placed in research field plots, and survivorship and growth were monitored. Data from the first reported oyster restoration research in the New Jersey (NJ) portion of the HRE indicate that oysters could indeed be reintroduced into the ecosystem. After 11 months in situ, research oyster survival rates as high as 60% were observed. Qualitative tissue observations indicated female oysters produced eggs that appeared normal and were ready for spawning. Biodiversity of species collected from the field plots was two-to threefold greater with adult research oysters present, suggesting that oysters increased the density and abundance of other marine species. Sediment deposition patterns indicated that the presence of oysters in support structures may reduce the degree of topographic relief caused by winter storm energies. The research ended abruptly on August 9, 2010, when New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection rescinded the project permit because of concerns that research oysters were beginning to reach New Jersey's market size of 2.5 inches. Although initial data suggest that oysters can survive and reproduce in Raritan Bay and the potential exists to achieve oyster restoration goals included in the CRP, the project also highlights the current lack of agreement between shellfishery regulators and restoration practitioners with respect to oyster reintroduction in waters where shellfish harvesting is currently prohibited. Different shellfish management approaches are used in New England states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut), where local control is an important management tool, and in Chesapeake Bay states (Maryland and Virginia), where federal involvement is relatively high. Situated between these two distinct shellfish-producing regions, New Jersey and New York have not supported aggressive reestablishment of historic Eastern Oyster populations in the HRE, and unlike adjacent states, have not developed long-term oyster aquaculture plans.

We tested F. hunteria's preference between oysters, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), and snails, Urosalpinx cinerea (Say), two ecologically co-occurring prey items that require different attack behaviors to subdue. Based on cost benefit analyses, U. cinerea is more energetically profitable than C. virginica, so we predicted that it should be favored by tulip snails.

Despite the vast differences between the prey items in terms of potential biomass reward, handling times, and risk to the predator. F. hunteria did not prefer either C. virginica or U. cinerea, live or crushed. Our results suggest F. hunteria has no strong preferences among prey items in its diet, and is an opportunistic predator.

We identify five parameters descriptive of basic characteristics of the shell carbonate budget of a reef that limit simulation accuracy. Two describe the TAZ (taphonomically-active zone) and the distribution of shell carbonate within it. One is the taphonomic rate in the TAZ. Two determine the volume contribution of shell carbonate and the taphonomic loss rate within the reef framework. For Mid-Atlantic estuaries, model simulations suggest that reef accretion only occurs if oyster abundance is near carrying capacity. Simulations further suggest that reef accretion is infeasible for any estuarine reach where dermo is a controlling influence on population dynamics. We forecast that the oyster disease dermo is a principal antagonist of reef persistence through its ability to limit shell addition. Model simulations suggest that reefs with inadequate shell addition 'protect themselves' by limiting the volumetric content of shell carbonate in the TAZ. Thus, a dominant process is the transient expansion and contraction of the shell resource, otherwise termed cultch, within the TAZ, rarely expanding enough to generate reef accretion, yet rarely contracting enough to foster erosion of the reef framework. The loss of framework carbonate thusly is curtailed during periods when the surficial shell layer deteriorates. Stasis, a reef neither accreting nor eroding, is a preferred state. Reef recession requires an inordinately unbalanced shell carbonate budget. Results strongly argue for expanded focus on the dynamics of the shell resource within the TAZ, as this likely fosters a feedback loop with abundance through recruitment, serves as the protective layer for the reef during periods of reef stasis, and establishes the threshold conditions for reef accretion and recession. Model simulations suggest that attaining maximum sustainable yield and maintaining a biomass capable of supporting sufficient shell production for reef accretion are irreconcilable goals over a large component of the oyster's range. Reef stasis would appear to be the only achievable restoration goal in Mid-Atlantic estuarine reaches where dermo holds sway. Exploitation rates much above 5% of the fishable stock per year restrict availability of surficial shell and foster reef erosion. In contrast, in the Gulf of Mexico at the high-productivity end of the oyster's range, an enhanced fishery and reef accretion may be compatible goals.","2012-05","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"505-558",NA,"3-Feb","70",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000309090000012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Larval abundances for all 3 species were higher in 2009 than in 2007 and were positively correlated with temperature in both years. Differences in larval abundance and size structure between bay sites were attributed to salinity tolerances and potential source locations. Higher survival in 2009 than in 2007, as determined by number of pediveligers, was likely due to higher temperatures and greater food availability during the peak abundance months of July and August in 2009. Yearly differences in larval growth and survival can have a large impact on recruitment. Knowing the optimal periods and locations for larval abundance and survival can be useful for isolating species-specific patterns in larval dispersal and to aid resource managers in enhancing or restoring depleted populations.","2012","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"53-69",NA,"","469",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000311553600005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, the distributions of three resident crab species, the flat mud crab (also known as the flatback mud crab) Eurypanopeus depressus, the common mud crab (also known as the Atlantic mud crab) Panopeus herbstii, and the invasive green porcelain crab Petrolisthes armatus, were examined with respect to sedimentation on six restored intertidal eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica sites in South Carolina. Sedimentation among sites ranged from 4% to 60% cover and was composed of silty clay and sand. Crab associations with sedimentation differed among species. Common mud crabs and green porcelain crab densities were negatively correlated with percent sediment cover, whereas flat mud crab densities were not related to sediment cover. Flat mud crabs occupy the interstices of the reef, and their densities were positively correlated with scorched mussel Brachidontes exustus densities. Total crab biomass and individual body weight were converted to annual secondary production estimates, which ranged from 6.1 to 27.2 g/m(2) (ash-free dry weight) among sites. Sedimentation on oyster habitat reduced crab annual secondary production beyond a prediction made by a proportional inverse relationship between percent sediment cover and crab secondary production. As an example, at 50% sediment cover, crab annual secondary production was reduced by 68%. The discrepancy between observed and predicted (proportional) reductions in crab secondary production estimates were most pronounced when sedimentation levels were less than 60% cover. These results suggest the use of proportional loss estimates tomitigate for sedimentation impacts on oyster habitat, when quantified as percent sediment cover, do not adequately compensate for impacts to resident crabs and consequential energy loss to crustacean and fish predators that include many important recreational and commercial species.","2012","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"838-847",NA,"5","32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000309388200004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mean estimates of the drag coefficient, CD, used as a measure of hydrodynamic roughness over the C. virginica reef were found to be 2 times greater than over the restoration sites and 5 times greater than over the mud bed. Enhanced fluid shear increased both peak Reynolds stresses and vertical momentum transport above the reef, but within the interstitial areas between individual oysters, velocities and turbulence were reduced. Larval settlement plates of varying triangular-shaped benthic roughness were used to mimic the natural topographic variability found along oyster reefs. The greatest larval recruitment occurred along interstitial regions between high-roughness topography, where shear stresses, which act to dislodge larvae, were found to be up to 20 times smaller than along exposed surfaces. Greater recruitment was also found on the more hydrodynamically rough whelk shell compared to the oyster shell restoration site.

Shell planting has been a main component of oyster restoration efforts in many habitats and has been carried out on scales from individual and grassroots efforts to multiagency efforts across entire estuaries. However, the cycling and lifetime of the shell that makes up the bulk of an oyster reef has only recently received attention, and most of the work to date has focused on the role of epi- and endobionts on shell degradation. Here we report findings from a laboratory study in which we manipulated pH in a flow-through control system using water from the mesohaline mouth of the Patuxent River to measure dissolution rates of intact oyster shell. Shells from the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin 1791) with three different legacies were exposed to 4 levels of pH that encompass a range typical of the mesohaline waters of the Chesapeake Bay (similar to 7.2-7.9 on the NBS scale). Mass loss over a 2-wk period was used to measure dissolution rate on 3 shell legacies: fresh, weathered, and dredged. We found that pH and shell legacy had significant effects on shell dissolution rate, with lower pH increasing dissolution rate. Fresh shell had the highest dissolution rate, followed by weathered then dredged shell. Dissolution rates were significantly different among all 4 pH treatments, except between the lowest (similar to 7.2) and the next lowest (similar to 7.4); however, shells lost mass even under noncorrosive conditions (similar to 7.9). We discuss the implications of our findings to ongoing efforts to understand shell budgets and cycling in oyster reef habitat, the interaction of biological and geochemical agents of shell degradation, and the complexity associated with shell carbonate cycling in the unique milieu of the oyster reef.","2011-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"659-669",NA,"3","30",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000299138700008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reefs provide structure and refuge for juvenile fish and crustaceans, and may be loci for predator foraging. However, reef morphology influences the relative value of refuge and forage functions, and reef utilization by benthic, epibenthic, and nektonic organisms. Reef fragmentation increases the edge to interior ratio, and may enhance use by organisms that favor edge regions, or decrease use by species requiring more interior habitat. The influence of fragmentation was examined using created intertidal oyster reefs and natural reef patches in southeastern North Carolina. Experimental treatments included created reefs (uniform circular reefs, small fragmented reefs, and large fragmented reefs) reference natural reefs, and open mudflat areas. Naturally occurring uniform and fragmented patch reefs in two nearby tidal creeks were also sampled. Following construction of created reefs, all treatments were sampled quarterly over two years, targeting infauna, epifauna, and nekton. Effects of fragmentation on infauna were variable, with a combination of positive and negative species-specific responses. For the vast majority of epi-benthic macrofauna collected from excavations and Breder traps, no effect of small-scale fragmentation on utilization was observed. Preferential use of large fragmented reefs over small fragmented reefs was observed for two species, Lagodon rhomboides and Panopeus herbstii, suggesting that the small fragmented reefs may have been below the patch size threshold at which edge effects become beneficial. Our results suggest that, at least at the scale investigated here, multiple small reefs may provide similar habitat benefits to a single, larger oyster reef. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These findings suggest the existence of alternative stable states in oyster reef populations. We developed a mathematical model consisting of three differential equations that represent volumes of live oysters, dead oyster shells (=accreting reef), and sediment. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations demonstrated that multiple nonnegative equilibria can exist for live oyster, accreting reef and sediment volume at an ecologically reasonable range of parameter values; the initial height of oyster reefs determined which equilibrium was reached. This investigation thus provides a conceptual framework for alternative stable states in native oyster populations, and can be used as a tool to improve the likelihood of success in restoration efforts.

Despite improvements in wastewater treatment in some watersheds and subsequent reduced nutrient loading to neighboring estuaries, seagrass and bivalve populations in these locations have generally not recovered. We performed three mesocosm experiments to simultaneously examine the contrasting effects of nutrient loading and historic suspension-feeding bivalve densities on the growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina), juvenile bivalves (northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; and bay scallops, Argopecten irradians), and juvenile planktivorous fish (sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus). High nutrient loading rates led to significantly higher phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) levels in all experiments, significantly increased growth of juvenile bivalves relative to controls with lower nutrient loading rates in two experiments, and significantly reduced the growth of eelgrass in one experiment. The filtration provided by adult suspension feeders (M. mercenaria and C. virginica) significantly decreased phytoplankton levels in all experiments, significantly increased light penetration and the growth of eelgrass in one experiment, and significantly decreased the growth of juvenile bivalves and fish in two experiments, all relative to controls with no filtration from adult suspension feeders. These results demonstrate that an appropriate level of nutrient loading can have a positive effect on some estuarine resources and that bivalve filtration can mediate the effects of nutrient loading to the benefit or detriment of different estuarine resources.

Oyster reefs offer diverse ecological and social services for people and natural environments; unfortunately, reefs are also highly sensitive to impairment from natural and human-induced disasters. Understanding the resilience of oyster reef communities to disturbance is key to developing effective conservation and restoration plans. Florida's Big Bend coastline (Gulf of Mexico coast from Crystal River to Apalachee Bay) supports large expanses of oyster reef habitat that have existed for thousands of years in a region that is one of the most pristine coastal zones in the continental US. We assessed trends in oyster habitat along the Big Bend region between 1982 and 2011 by examining changes in areal extent and distance of oyster reefs from shore. During our study period, we found a 66% net loss of oyster reef area (124.05 ha) with losses concentrated on offshore (88%), followed by nearshore (61%), and inshore reefs (50%). We also found that the spatial distribution of oyster reefs was moving inland. This rapid loss is likely a departure from historic geological succession. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the primary mechanism for these observed losses in oyster reefs is reduced survival and recruitment, likely a result of decreased freshwater inputs which increases existing reef vulnerability to wave action and sea level rise. Once oyster reef substrate becomes unconsolidated and the nucleation site is lost, the regeneration of the oyster reef may not be reversible through natural processes. To test these predictions, we recommend restoration-based experiments to elicit the mechanisms of decline in order to foster long-term sustainability of estuarine habitat critical to oysters.","2011-10","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"UNSP 114",NA,"10","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000208811100008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A tradeoff between growth rate and disease prevalence as a function of salinity makes the estuarine salinity transition of special concern for oyster survival and restoration. Estuarine salinity varies with discharge, so increases or decreases in precipitation with climate change may shift regions of low salinity and disease refuge away from optimal oyster bottom habitat, negatively impacting reproduction and survival. Temperature is an additional factor for oyster survival, and recent temperature increases have increased vulnerability to disease in higher salinity regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined growth, reproduction, and survival of oysters in the New York Harbor-Hudson River region, focusing on a low-salinity refuge in the estuary. Observations were during two years when rainfall was above average and comparable to projected future increases in precipitation in the region and a past period of about 15 years with high precipitation. We found a clear tradeoff between oyster growth and vulnerability to disease. Oysters survived well when exposed to intermediate salinities during two summers (2008, 2010) with moderate discharge conditions. However, increased precipitation and discharge in 2009 reduced salinities in the region with suitable benthic habitat, greatly increasing oyster mortality. To evaluate the estuarine conditions over longer periods, we applied a numerical model of the Hudson to simulate salinities over the past century. Model results suggest that much of the region with suitable benthic habitat that historically had been a low salinity refuge region may be vulnerable to higher mortality under projected increases in precipitation and discharge. Conclusions/Significance: Predicted increases in precipitation in the northeastern United States due to climate change may lower salinities past important thresholds for oyster survival in estuarine regions with appropriate substrate, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics and impeding oyster restoration efforts, especially in the Hudson estuary where a large basin constitutes an excellent refuge from disease.","4/28/11","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e18849",NA,"4","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000290020700005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The long-term efficacy of management strategies for suppressing this disease in both aquaculture and restoration settings depends on the potential rate of evolutionary response by P. marinus. Sexual reproduction has never been demonstrated in vitro or in previous population genetic studies. We developed high resolution microsatellite markers and amplified alleles directly from infected oyster genomic DNA. Of 336 infected oysters from four populations between Massachusetts and Florida, 129 (48%) appeared to be infected with a single parasite genotype and were subjected to population genetic analyses assuming diploidy. The great diversity of multilocus genotypes observed is incompatible with strictly clonal reproduction. Substantial heterozygote deficits in three populations suggest that sexual reproduction often involves inbreeding. At the same time, significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium occurred in most sampled populations, and several genotypes were sampled repeatedly in each of two populations, indicating that asexual reproduction also occurs in P. marinus populations. Interestingly, where this parasite has recently expanded its range, lower strain diversity, significant heterozygote excess, and highly heterozygous multilocus genotypes suggests clonal propagation of recent recombinants. Taken together, these data suggest that P. marinus employs multiple reproductive modes, and that over the short term, selection acts upon independent parasite lineages rather than upon individual loci in a cohesive, interbreeding population. Nevertheless, high genotypic diversity is the evolutionary legacy of sex in P. marinus. Anthropogenic movement of infected oysters may increase outcrossing opportunities, potentially facilitating rapid evolution of this parasite. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Habitat area declined nearly 70% (90% CI, 36.2 to 83.3%) during 1980 to 2009. Natural mortality (mortality from all non-fishing sources) of market-sized oysters varied substantially and increased during 1986 to 1987 and 2000 to 2002, and natural mortality of small oysters approximately doubled after 1986. The exploitation rate varied over time and averaged 25.1% yr(-1) (90% CI, 16.1 to 33.1%) during 1980 to 2008. Fishing and disease have had substantial negative impacts on the population, but effects of fishing have been stronger than increased natural mortality. We recommend a moratorium on fishing to minimize the risk of extirpation and provide an opportunity for recovery.","2011","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"131-144",NA,"","436",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000294619800009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to local runoff and the excess nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) entering the WRR from the Chesapeake Bay, water quality in these sub-estuaries has steadily declined over the last forty years. Models and data analysis have shown that as much as 90% of nutrient and TSS inputs to the WRR enter via inflowing tidal water from the Chesapeake Bay; therefore, community outreach efforts are predicted to have little impact on water quality. Three alternative designs have been identified that have the potential to decrease turbidity and stimulate growth in subaquatic vegetation (SAV): addition of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria), and living shoreline restoration (LSR). The oysters and clams act as water filters, while LSR prevents runoff from entering the water. A 2-D Tidal Mixing Model (2DTMM) was developed to simulate the dynamic interaction between these alternatives and the nutrients and TSS entering the sub-estuary. The goal of this project is to find the design alternative, amount, and placement that would maximize the water quality in the WRR at minimum cost. The optimal placement and dollar-value configurations for each design alternative were further modeled in the Estuarine Eutrophication Model, which simulates improvements in dissolved oxygen concentrations and provides more precise water clarity calculations than the 2DTMM. An analysis of cost versus utility (water quality improvement, sustainability, and public approval) shows that the addition of approximately 20 million clams would be the most cost-effective alternative.","2011","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000298729200017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Neeley, K.

Among the many potential factors that could affect efforts to produce oysters through aquaculture or supplementation of shell beds is substratum condition. The present study examined larval setting on field-produced biofilms from Little Wicomico River (Virginia, USA) to assess whether bacterial community structure (examined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, T-RFLP) or other characteristics of contemporary biofilms in this tributary (biofilm age and mass, algal abundance, and percentage organic matter) inhibited setting of larval oysters. The structure of the natural and heterogenous bacterial community in the biofilms and the success of oyster set were correlated, suggesting that specific microbial species may play a role in oyster setting. Larval set increased with biofilm age and mass, suggesting that established field-produced biofilms have no inhibitory effect. In contrast, the percentage of organic matter was negatively correlated with oyster set, whereas chlorophyll a concentration had no observed effect. The study expands prior knowledge by providing a more realistic timeframe for biofilm development (weeks as opposed to days), recounting effects of biofilms that are more representative of the natural dynamic and disturbance processes that would be expected to occur on submerged structures, and by incorporating seasonal and spatial variation. An important negative effect observed during the study period was heavy predation by Stylochus ellipticus on newly set oysters. Overall, the results of this study, which is the first assessment of the effects of biofilms produced naturally within a Chesapeake Bay tributary, suggest that the absence of large numbers of oysters in Little Wicomico River is not related to microbes or other specific characteristics of biofilms that develop on suitable setting substrata, but rather to heavy predation of newly set larvae.","2011","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"255-265",NA,"3","27",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000288267300002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rising implementation costs and difficulty achieving nutrient reduction goals associated with point and nonpoint sources suggests that approaches supplemental to source reductions may prove useful in the future. Enhanced oyster aquaculture has been suggested as one potential policy initiative to help rid the Bay waters of excess nutrients via harvest of bioassimilated nutrients. To assess this potential, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and total carbon (TC) content were measured in oyster tissue and shell at two floating-raft cultivation sites in the Chesapeake Bay. Models were developed based on the common market measurement of total length (TL) for aquacultured oysters, which was strongly correlated to the TN (R-2 = 0.76), TP (R-2 = 0.78), and TC (R-2 = 0.76) content per oyster tissue and shell. These models provide resource managers with a tool to quantify net nutrient removal. Based on model estimates, 10(6) harvestsized oysters (76 mm TL) remove 132 kg TN, 19 kg TP, and 3823 kg TC. In terms of nutrients removed per unit area, oyster harvest is an effective means of nutrient removal compared with other nonpoint source reduction strategies. At a density of 286 oysters m(-2), assuming no mortality, harvestsize nutrient removal rates can be as high as 378 kg TN ha(-1), 54 kg TP ha(-1), and 10,934 kg TC ha(-1) for 76-mm oysters.

Oysters grown in floating structures are subsequently planted in bays, where they continue to live, grow, and spawn; filter the water; contribute to the larval pool; and provide habitat. Our study is one of the first evaluations of habitat value provided by floating oyster gardens in a degraded mid-Atlantic estuary. Oyster growth and survival within the floats was monitored in a eutrophic, turbid, periodically hypoxic, soft-bottom coastal lagoon system. We examined the abundance and diversity of fishes and invertebrates with respect to 3 replicated treatments: live oyster clusters, disarticulated oyster shell, and a float with no shells or oysters. We also studied the effects of 2 cleaning frequencies (biweekly and monthly) on species assemblages, and the growth and survival of oysters, and monitored basic water quality parameters. The species assemblages in floats with oyster clusters were very similar to those with loose shell but considerably different than that of empty floats. Cleaning frequency (biweekly and monthly) did not affect the growth or survival of oysters. Location of floats within the canal system, however, was a large determinant of oyster vital rates as well as community structure. Forty-nine species of fishes and invertebrates, and 8 species of macroalgae were collected from floating oyster gardens, including 9 commercial or recreational fishery species, many of which are likely habitat limited in the Inland Bays because of the loss of tidal wetlands, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds. Newly settled juvenile oysters have been found for the first time within the floating oyster gear in the manmade, residential canal systems.

Using handheld GPS computers, we conducted an on-the-ground inventory of living intertidal oyster reefs at four separate locations, and have concluded that previous surveys were not comprehensive or accurate enough to facilitate a reliable quantitative assessment of habitat loss. Alternatively, we have shown that intertidal oyster reefs are remarkably resilient and may occur in greater abundance today than when first documented in 1891. Rather than a collapse of oyster stocks, declining trends in fishery landings reflect the social and economic challenges associated with an unsustainable canning industry during the early 20th century. In addition, we challenge the axiom that the condition of existing intertidal reef habitat has deteriorated. Areas of shell deposits attributed to exhausted beds in historical assessments may in fact represent naturally occurring coastal features. Nonetheless, enhancement and conservation efforts are worthy efforts, because intertidal oyster habitat increases the health and resiliency of coastal Georgia by providing essential fish habitat, flood control, erosion abatement, and pollution reduction services.

We do not believe that our data discount the importance and/or usefulness of oysters in modifying the water column. Rather, we acknowledge that it is difficult to detect these impacts/environmental services in this type of system (i.e., a tidal creek system), because they seem to be very localized and short-lived (i.e., not ecologically relevant on a creek-wide scale).

All sites included multiple-aged reefs (1-3 years old) at the time of the fall 2004 sampling. Resident crabs and mussels were abundant at all five sites and crab assemblages were related to the size structure of the oyster microhabitat. Scorched mussel (Brachidontes exustus) abundances were most frequently correlated with oyster and other resident species abundances. Associations among oysters and resident crabs and mussels were not evident when analyses were conducted with higher level taxonomic groupings (e.g., total number of crabs, mussels, or oysters), indicating that species-level identifications improve our understanding of interactions among reef inhabitants and oyster populations. Community-based restoration sites in South Carolina provide habitat for mussels and resident crabs, in some cases in the absence of dense populations of relatively large oysters.

Although oyster shells were discarded as trash after the oysters were eaten, the environmental and ecological data recorded in the bivalve geochemistry during shell deposition remain intact over centuries, thereby providing a unique window into conditions during the earliest Jamestown years. We compare oxygen isotope data from these 17th century oyster shells with modern shells to quantify and contrast estuarine salinity, season of oyster collection, and shell provenance during Jamestown colonization (1609-1616) and the 21st century. Data show that oysters were collected during an extended drought between fall 1611 and summer 1612. The drought shifted the 14 psu isohaline above Jamestown Island, facilitating individual oyster growth and extension of oyster habitat upriver toward the colony, thereby enhancing local oyster food resources. Data from distinct well layers suggest that the colonists also obtained oysters from reefs near Chesapeake Bay to augment oyster resources near Jamestown Island.

We use an optimization approach to identify the locations where oyster restoration efforts are most likely to maximize one or more benefits such as reduction in seston, increase in light penetration, spawning stock enhancement, and harvest, subject to funding constraints and other limitations. This proof-of-concept Oyster Restoration Optimization model (ORO) incorporates predictions from three-dimensional water quality (nutrients-phytoplankton-zooplankton detritus [NPZD] with oyster filtration) and larval transport models; calculates size- and salinity-dependent growth, mortality, and fecundity of oysters; and includes economic costs of restoration efforts. Model results indicate that restoration of oysters in different regions of the Chesapeake Bay would maximize different suites of benefits due to interactions between the physical characteristics of a system and nonlinear biological processes. For example, restoration locations that maximize harvest are not the same as those that would maximize spawning stock enhancement. Although preliminary, the ORO model demonstrates that our understanding of circulation patterns, single-species population dynamics and their interactions with the ecosystem can be integrated into one quantitative framework that optimizes spending allocations and provides explicit advice along with testable predictions. The ORO model has strengths and constraints as a tool to support restoration efforts and ecosystem approaches to fisheries management.","2010-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"851-866",NA,"3","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000277077400020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A local Standard oyster strain was used as a reference control, and selected oysters belonged to disease-tolerant DEBY and CROSBreed strains. Initial deployment was in September 2003, during a period of unusually low salinity. Mean river salinities during the first 2 y were 8.5 parts per thousand and 9.0 parts per thousand, respectively, but these rose to historically typical levels of 11.5 parts per thousand and 11.3 parts per thousand during the third and fourth years. Although measuring possible differential effects of dermo disease pressure on the 3 strains was our primary goal, disease pressures were only slight or moderate during all but the final year of the study. Oysters grew well during most of the study, except at the upriver station, where salinities were less than 5 parts per thousand during much of the first year. The DEBY strain showed the best overall growth and survival. Standard and CROS Breed strains were similar in both growth and survival, and did not perform as well as DEBYs. Although P. marinus infection prevalences approached 90-100% among oysters at the 2 downriver sites, even during the first year, and were generally high in late summer each year, oyster body burdens of pathogen cells increased slowly throughout the study, with means reaching lethal levels of 106 parasite cells/g tissue only among Standards and DEBYs, and only during the fourth year. P. marinus infections among sympatric feral oysters (the probable source of disseminated cells infecting SPF oysters), were low during all years at the upriver site, but increased each year with increasing salinities at the downriver sites. As measured by better growth and survival, DEBYs performed best among the 3 strains tested. Whether DEBYs have a use in oyster restoration efforts is controversial, but their value in aquaculture applications appears evident.","2010-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"161-175",NA,"1","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000276267900021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In response, laboratory-reared spat and juvenile oysters have been raised in specialized facilities and then placed on restored bars. The relative efficacy of this technique versus other methods for growing juvenile oysters remains unknown. In this study, work was performed to determine biological response and hydrodynamic design techniques to specify vertically oriented oyster farming structures. The study was conducted considering sites in the upper Chesapeake Bay. To assess biological response, oyster growth rates in trays deployed at 0.5 m increments were measured over a nine-month period at a representative location with a depth of 3.5 m. The growth of the oysters was compared with those placed in trays on a nearby restored bar (depth of 2 m). Although oyster loss was substantial in trays deployed at depths of 0.5 and 1.0 m, changes in oyster height over the course of the experiment (0.06 mm d(-1)) did not differ significantly among depth treatments or between the vertical trays and those on the restored bar. This indicates that the deployment of vertical arrays of trays with a minimal depth of 1.0 m may efficiently utilize the water column to grow out juvenile C. virginica. To develop hydrodynamic design techniques, a series of full scale tests was conducted with a stack of trays with oyster shells at the U.S. Naval Academy, Hydromechanics Laboratory. The stack of trays was subjected to steady tow velocities and oscillatory flows to examine drag and inertia force characteristics as a function of both Reynolds and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers. With force coefficient results, a loading scheme was developed for a prototype oyster grow out structure by applying Stoke's second order wave theory and the Morison equation. Environmental conditions representative of the Severn River (Annapolis, MD, USA) were used in the analysis and consisted of waves with a height of I m and a period of 5 s with a current of 0.5 m s(-1). The results of the hydrodynamic forcing calculations yielded a horizontal design load of 1100 N. which was then used to specify components of the grow out Structure.

The demographics of oyster populations that would be required to maintain reef accretion rates commensurate with sea level rise over geological time frames are examined using estimates of oyster longevity in pre-colonial (pre-1600) times combined with parallel estimates of pre-disease endemic mortality. The analysis demonstrates that modern populations, with their disease related, age-truncated demographics, are generally not capable of maintaining and building biogenic reefs through accretion. Estimates of filtration rates associated with Chesapeake Bay oyster populations prior to 1600 considerably underestimate actual benthic-pelagic coupling during that period. Pristine oyster populations would have supported water column turnover rates on the order of minutes to hours. Thus, the spatial footprint of oyster reefs was limited by available productivity in the estuary.

Reefs of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica are a dominant feature of the estuaries along the Southwest Florida coast. Oysters are benthic, sessile, filter-feeding organisms that provide ecosystem services by filtering the water column and providing food, shelter and habitat for associated organisms. As such, the species is an excellent sentinel organism for examining the impacts of restoration on estuarine ecosystems. The implementation of CERP attempts to improve: the hydrology and spatial and structural characteristics of oyster reefs, the recruitment and survivorship of C. virginica, and the reef-associated communities of organisms. This project links biological responses and environmental conditions relative to hydrological changes as a means of assessing positive or negative trends in oyster responses and population trends. Using oyster responses, we have developed a communication tool (i.e., Stoplight Report Card) based on CERP performance measures that can distinguish between responses to restoration and natural patterns. The Stoplight Report Card system is a communication tool that uses Monitoring and Assessment Program (MAP) performance measures to grade an estuary's response to changes brought about by anthropogenic input or restoration activities. The Stoplight Report Card consists of both a suitability index score for each organism metric as well as a trend score (- decreasing trend, +/- no change in trend, and + increasing trend). Based on these two measures, a component score (e.g., living density) is calculated by averaging the suitability index score and the trend score. The final index score is obtained by taking the geometric score of each component, which is then translated into a stoplight color for success (green), caution (yellow), or failure (red). Based on the data available for oyster populations and the responses of oysters in the Caloosahatchee Estuary, the system is currently at stage ""caution."" This communication tool instantly conveys the status of the indicator and the suitability, while trend curves provide information on progress towards reaching a target. Furthermore, the tool has the advantage of being able to be applied regionally, by species, and collectively, in concert with other species, system-wide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports on the lethal effects of clonal cultures and blooms of Cochlodinium polykrikoides from the US Atlantic coast on the larvae of three species of commercially and ecologically valuable bivalves: the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians), and the Northern quahog (hard clam; Mercenaria mercenaria). Both cultures and blooms of C. polykrikoides were highly toxic to all three species of bivalve larvae causing 80-100% mortality during 24- to 72-h exposures at concentrations of 1-2 x 10(3) cells ml(-1). Toxicity was dependent on cell densities, growth stage of C. polykrikoides (i.e. cultures in exponential stage growth were more toxic than later stages), exposure time of larvae to cells (i.e. longer exposure caused higher mortality), the age of larvae (i.e. younger larvae were more sensitive), and the relative abundance of C. polykrikoides (i.e. the presence of other microalgae decreased toxicity). Free radical-scavenging enzymes (peroxidase and catalase) and the removal of C. polykrikoides cells (i.e. culture filtrate) significantly increased larval survival suggesting toxicity is maximized by contact with live cells and may involve labile toxins bound by these compounds including e.g. reactive oxygen species. The toxicity of C. polykrikoides to bivalve larvae was generally more severe than other HAB species (e.g. Karenia brevis, Karlodinium veneficum, Alexandrium tamarense, Prorocentrum minimum). Since the bivalves in this study spawn in the months when C. polykrikoides blooms on the east coast of North America, these results suggest that these blooms may have detrimental effects on efforts to restore these already diminished populations.","2009-11","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"2601-2611",NA,"12","156",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000270721000016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biochemical indicators of organism physiological condition have been widely used to evaluate habitat quality and for early detection of the impact of stressors. Mangrove crabs may be useful bioindicators of the quality of mangrove habitats, as they are characteristic and ecologically important organisms in mangrove environments. 3. The physiological condition (evaluated by the RNA/DNA ratio) of Perisesarma guttatum (Grapsidae) and Uca annulipes (Ocypodidae) was assessed to determine its potential as an indicator of habitat quality in one polluted and two relatively unpolluted Mozambican mangroves, during the rainy and dry seasons. 4. Both species showed seasonal effects on RNA/DNA ratio, but only U. annulipes was significantly affected by pollution. RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes may thus be a useful indicator of pollution and seasonality in mangrove habitats. There was a synergistic negative effect of the rainy season and pollution on the RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes. Due to higher DNA, rather than lower RNA contents, the RNA/DNA ratio of P. guttatum was always significantly lower than that of U. annulipes. 5.

Increased seston concentrations, which decrease light penetration, are likely one of the main causes of the decline in Chesapeake Bay. It has been hypothesized that dense populations of suspension-feeding bivalves, such as eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), may filter sufficient seston from the water to reduce light attenuation and enhance seagrass growth. Furthermore, eastern oyster populations can form large three-dimensional reef-like structures that may act like breakwaters by attenuating waves, thus decreasing sediment resuspension. We developed a quasi-three-dimensional Seagrass-Waves-Oysters-Light-Seston (SWOLS) model to investigate whether oyster reefs and breakwaters could improve seagrass growth by reducing seston concentrations. Seagrass growth potential (SGP), a parameter controlled by resuspension-induced turbidity, was calculated in simulations in which wave height, oyster abundance, and reef/breakwater configuration were varied. Wave height was the dominant factor influencing SGP, with higher waves increasing sediment resuspension and decreasing SGP. Submerged breakwaters parallel with the shoreline improved SGP in the presence of 0.2 and 0.4 m waves when sediment resuspension was dominated by wave action, while submerged groins perpendicular to the shoreline improved SGP under lower wave heights (0.05 and 0.1 m) when resuspension was dominated by along-shore tidal currents. Oyster-feeding activity did not affect SGP, due to the oysters' distance from the seagrass bed and reduced oyster filtration rates under either low or high sediment concentrations. Although the current implementation of the SWOLS model has simplified geometry, the model does demonstrate that the interaction between oyster filtration and along-shore circulation, and between man-made structures and wave heights, should be considered when managing seagrass habitats, planning seagrass restoration projects, and choosing the most suitable methods to protect shorelines from erosion.","2009-07","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"748-757",NA,"4","32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000266815300012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Additionally, we demonstrate that low-cost experiments prior to the initiation of restoration activities can help ensure Success by providing critical in situ information on design and location.","2009-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"185-192",NA,"2","28",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000265460900002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Man of these estuaries no longer have healthy, productive reefs because of impacts from destructive fishing, sediment accumulation, pollution, and parasites. Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, Such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners have used a broad range of nonmutually exclusive approaches, including: (1) oyster gardening of hatchery-produced oysters; (2) deployment of juvenile to adult shellfish (""broodstock"") within designated areas for stock enhancement; and (3) substrate enhancement using natural or recycled man-made materials loose or in ""bags"" designed to enhance local settlement success. Many of these approaches are inspired by fishery-enhancement efforts or the past, though are implemented with different outcomes in mind (ecological services vs. fishery outcomes). This paper was originally presented at the first West Coast Restoration Workshop in 2006 in San Rafael, California and is intended to summarize potential approaches for small-scale restoration projects, including some emerging methods, and highlight the logistical benefits and limitations of these approaches. Because the majority of the past efforts have been with C. viriginica. we use those examples initially to highlight efforts with the intent of enlightening current west coast United States efforts with Ostrea lurida. We also discuss site-specific characteristics including ""recruitment bottlenecks"" and ""substrate limitation"" as criteria for identifying the most appropriate approaches to use for small-scale restoration projects. Many of the included - lessons-learned"" from the smaller-scale restoration projects being implemented today can be used to inform not only large-scale estuary wide efforts to restore C. virginica, but also the relatively nascent efforts directed at restoring the United States west coast's native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida.","2009-03","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"147-161",NA,"1","28",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000265177200015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Filtration and pseudofeces production","Aquatic Biology","","1864-7790","10.3354/ab00121",NA,"Bivalve molluscs feeding on toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are the main vector of domoic acid (DA) to humans. Although different oyster species rarely exceed the internationally adopted regulatory level for shellfish harvesting closures (20 mu g g(-1)), these are often applied to all bivalve species in an affected area. This study examines the influence of diet composition and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cell size, density and toxicity on oyster feeding rates to determine potential pre-ingestive mechanisms that may lead to low DA accumulation in the oysters Crassostrea virginica. Clearance rate (CR) and pseudofeces production of juvenile oysters were quantified under varying laboratory conditions representative of natural Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. Oysters filtered increasing amounts of P. multiseries cells as cell density increased, but ingestion was limited by pseudofeces production at concentrations > 10 400 cells ml(-1) (ca. 6 mg dry weight l(-1)). Oysters significantly reduced their CR when fed both toxic and non-toxic P. multiseries clones in unialgal suspensions compared to Isochrysis galbana, and this rapid grazing inhibition was not related to growth stage, cell size, or exposure time. When offered mixed suspensions containing equivalent cellular volumes of the 2 species, however, relatively high CR was restored. Therefore, we suggest that DA intake by oysters from mono-specific Pseudo-nitzschia blooms would be limited by a persistently reduced CR and rejection of cells in pseudofeces. When an alternative, good source of food is present in a mixed phytoplankton assemblage with R multiseries, no CR inhibition is expected and DA intake will be regulated by pre-ingestive particle selection on the feeding organs, as demonstrated in Mafra et al.
