We developed stage-based population models for each region of the CRC in AD Model Builder using dredge survey and harvest data provided by Maryland Department of Natural Resources from 1989 to 2015. Patterns in exploitation rates over time varied among regions. Abundance generally decreased during 1989-2003 and increased thereafter. Recruitment was greatest in the late 1990s, 2010, and 2012, which led to increases in abundance. Natural mortality was low across all regions during 2004-2015.

These efforts are widely constrained by the availability, cost, and suitability of substrates to support oyster settlement and reef establishment. In particular, oyster shell is often the preferred substrate but is relatively scarce and increasingly expensive. Thus, there is a need for alternative oyster restoration materials that are cost-effective, abundant, and durable. Methods: We tested the viability of two low-cost substrates-concrete and recycled blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) traps-in facilitating oyster recovery in a replicated 22-month field experiment at historically productive but now degraded intertidal oyster grounds on northwestern Florida's Nature Coast. Throughout the trial, we monitored areal oyster cover on each substrate; at the end of the trial, we measured the densities of oysters by size class (spat, juvenile, and market-size) and the biomass and volume of each reef. Results: Oysters colonized the concrete structures more quickly than the crab traps, as evidenced by significantly higher oyster cover during the first year of the experiment. By the end of the experiment, the concrete structures hosted higher densities of spat and juveniles, while the density of market-size oysters was relatively low and similar between treatments. The open structure of the crab traps led to the development of larger-volume reefs, while oyster biomass per unit area was similar between treatments. In addition, substrates positioned at lower elevations (relative to mean sea level) supported higher oyster abundance, size, and biomass than those less frequently inundated at higher elevations. Discussion: Together, these findings indicate that both concrete and crab traps are viable substrates for oyster reef restoration, especially when placed at lower intertidal elevations conducive to oyster settlement and reef development.","2/25/19","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e6488",NA,"","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000459588900008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, 'Metapopulation Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical(e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the 'Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for 'Metapopulation Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., ""win-win"" locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., ""tradeoff"" locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits.","1/25/19","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0210936",NA,"1","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457037500075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Overharvesting, destructive fishing practices, and environmental degradation have caused significant declines in global oyster populations, necessitating restoration efforts in many regions to rebuild oyster habitat and recover lost services. Understanding how biological and physical gradients regulate oyster recruitment, survivorship and growth will help guide future efforts to successfully restore oyster populations. We conducted a field experiment in Ipswich, Massachusetts, to quantify the effects of tidal elevation, predator exclusion, and reef vertical relief on oyster settlement, recruitment and survivorship. Oyster settlement was 3 times greater at the deepest intertidal elevation compared to the 2 shallower intertidal elevations. Reef vertical relief and predator exclusion did not affect oyster settlement or survivorship. Despite increased sedimentation and algal fouling with increasing depth, living oyster densities remained significantly elevated at the deepest intertidal elevation 8 mo after the experimental reefs were constructed. Oyster mortality during this period was highest (>70%) at our shallowest elevation treatment, likely the result of desiccation and food limitation. Meanwhile, mortality during the first winter post-recruitment was high across all elevations (all >64 %), with our deepest elevation treatment experiencing the highest mortality rate (90%). Our results suggest that there is a gradient in oyster settlement rates, which increase at lower elevation, and that the dominant drivers of mortality also likely vary with elevation. Our findings highlight the need for region-specific studies to quantify biological and physical gradients prior to large-scale restoration efforts.","1/17/19","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"119-132",NA,"","609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000456207300008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although oyster reefs in the Bay occur in both tidal zones, subtidal reefs have received the most attention because they support most of the oyster fishery. The present study provides new information on the distribution, condition, and ecology of the intertidal reefs, and assessed the general utility of high-resolution satellite imagery for routine monitoring of the extent and condition of intertidal oysters. Using online, freely available color imagery and manual interpretation, a total of 782 individual reefs ranging in size from similar to 3 m(2) to 3.9 ha (= 9.7 acres) and covering a total of 94 ha (233 ac) of bottom area were mapped. Field inspection and sampling of 100 individual intertidal reefs on November 12-16. 2016, confirmed wide differences in the number and areal coverage of reefs in the three major geographic regions in the Bay: 433 reefs covering a total of 56 ha (139 acres) in the western area (St. Vincent Sound); 113 reefs covering 8 ha (19 acres) in the central area; and 236 reefs covering 30 ha (75 acres) in the eastern area (St. George Sound). Most reefs in the western portion of the bay consisted of recently dead (""box"") oysters in all size classes, suggesting a recent massive mortality event. Mean densities (all size classes combined) of live oysters in the central and eastern areas were 42.9/m(2) (+/- 7.39; 1 SE) and 99.3/m(2) (+/- 13.22; 1 SE), respectively, with an overall mean shell height of 23.6 nun. Size-frequency histograms indicated only two year classes of live oysters, and the largest oyster collected was 84 mm. Although detailed quantitative comparisons with subtidal reefs were not possible, data from the present study suggest that intertidal reefs cover much less bottom area of the bay, but may contain much higher live oyster densities. The present study also demonstrated the use of high-resolution satellite imagery for mapping reefs as small as a few square meters in surface area, and the potential for estimating relative reef condition measured by live oyster density.","2018-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1027-1038",NA,"5","37",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454313900014",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the capacity of diverse mid-Atlantic bivalves to filter particles and potentially enhance water clarity and quality. Species with the greatest clearance rates and population carrying capacity were also considered for their restoration and enhancement potential. Compared with eastern oysters, several additional species of saltwater bivalves and freshwater mussels are reported to filter water at rates that merit restoration attention and have been shown to attain significant population sizes. More work is needed to estimate system-carrying capacity and to eliminate restoration bottlenecks for some species-all bivalve species have constraints on their distribution and abundance.

Oyster reefs provide habitat and refuge for organisms, improve water quality, and decrease erosion. Oyster restoration projects aim to construct reefs that function similarly to their natural counterparts. Therefore, post-creation monitoring of these reefs is crucial in determining restoration success. However, monitoring is often lacking or focused only on oyster density and size rather than ecosystem functions such as nekton utilization. This study examines nekton utilization among created reefs compared to natural reefs in an estuary in Wilmington, North Carolina. The objective was to determine whether the created reefs function similarly to the natural reefs in abundance, species richness, and fish size. Using seine nets and Breder traps, reefs were sampled over a 5-month period. No significant difference was detected among reefs for nekton abundance, species richness, and standard length. This is a promising result for future management, indicating that created and natural reefs can support similar communities of fishes and shrimp.","2018-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"2426-2432",NA,"8","41",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000448508400020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster restoration, in particular, faces threats from alterations in precipitation, warming water temperatures, and urbanization of coastlines that dramatically change salinity patterns, foster the proliferation and spread disease, and disrupt habitat connectivity, respectively. New York City (NYC) coastal waters, once home to a booming oyster fishery for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), are now nearly devoid of live oyster reefs. Oyster restoration in urban estuaries is motivated by the synergistic ecosystem benefits this native keystone species can deliver. Recent surveys have documented substantial remnant populations of adult oysters in the upper low salinity zone of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary (HRE) near Tarrytown, NY. This study assessed fitness-related performance across the HRE salinity gradient to evaluate habitat suitability on an estuarine scale. Oysters were hatchery-produced from wild, moderate-salinity broodstock, then outplanted for measurement of growth, survival, reproduction and disease prevalence over two years. Survival was generally higher in the lower salinity river sites and in the higher salinity Jamaica Bay sites relative to mesohaline NYC harbor sites. Growth rate was highest in Jamaica Bay and had high variation among other sites. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of individuals with sex-differentiated gametes and the highest average gonad maturation index was found at a low salinity site. Consistent with the advanced gametogenesis measured in experimental animals at low salinity, annual wild recruitment was documented near the low salinity remnant population in each of five monitored years. These results suggest that the remnant HRE oyster population is a robust, self-sustaining population that can be leveraged to support restoration of subpopulations in other parts of the estuary, but further research is required to determine if the mesohaline and near-ocean reaches of the HRE can support the full oyster life cycle.","11/16/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0207368",NA,"11","13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000450420900029",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study characterized spatial effects of whole-reef (oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and other filter feeders on the reef) filtration in the water immediately above and adjacent to a small ( similar to 300 m(2)) intertidal reef in Tarpon Bay, Sanibel, Florida. Changes in water column parameters were measured in 2010 (chlorophyll a only) and 2013 (chlorophyll a and turbidity) by slowly paddling a kayak back-and-forth across the reef while logging position and water data. Although oysters were the dominant filter feeder, mussels, slipper shells, sponges, and a filter-feeding crab also occurred on the reef. Ambient water flow speed and direction were concurrently determined in 2013 by an acoustic-doppler current profiler. Measurements were made on two days (1-2 June) in 2010, and two days (November 15 and December 9) in 2013. ArcGIS software was used to plot the data and construct two-dimensional maps showing changes in chlorophyll a and turbidity, which clearly indicated the spatial extent of decreases in both as water flowed across the reef. Seston decrease (interpreted as depletion) levels were spatially variable, averaging 23-25% but as high as 68% in some areas directly over the reef. The extent of detectable depletion usually extended 10-20 m beyond the edge of the reef, potentially increasing light levels and thereby providing enhanced growth conditions for adjacent seagrasses and algae, suggesting that restoration success of macrophyte habitats could be enhanced by close spatial coupling with oyster reef restoration.","11/15/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"265-272",NA,"","212",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446286100026",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A century of habitat degradation has resulted in substantial reductions in the extent and quality of oyster reefs in many estuaries, thus spurring restoration efforts.

Oysters and resident and transient fishes and crustaceans were monitored at the restored reef as well as at nearby natural oyster reef and unrestored bottom (i.e., dense mud with shell hash) habitats for two years following reef construction. The restored reef had substantial oyster recruitment and growth, with oyster abundance and size comparable to nearby habitats within the first year. Resident and transient fauna communities recruited to the restored reef within six months post-construction, and abundance and diversity were comparable to nearby habitats. Significant changes observed in oyster densities between the first and second year post-restoration demonstrate the importance of monitoring over multiple years to capture multiple recruitment cycles and growth to market size. Nekton densities did not change significantly after the first year, but changes in community assemblages were observed through the end of the study. The high densities of oysters and resident nekton relative to other studies indicate that this restoration project was successful in restoring suitable habitat. The design of the reef complex, consisting of relatively high-relief reef mounds and deeper corridors, likely contributed to the relatively high oyster and nekton densities observed in this study.

Despite considerable investment, it is unclear how the scale of and approaches toward oyster restoration have evolved. A synthesis of 1768 projects undertaken since 1964 reveals that oyster substrate restoration efforts have primarily been concentrated in the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf Coast, have been heavily reliant on oyster shell, and have re-established 4.5% of the reef area that has been lost across all regions. By comparing costs to ecosystem service benefits, we discovered that the return-on-investment of oyster restoration varies widely, but generally increases with project size. To facilitate the recovery of coastal ecosystems and their services, scientists and resource managers must adopt a new restoration paradigm prioritizing investment in sites that maximize economic and ecological benefits and minimize construction costs.","2018-10","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"463-470",NA,"8","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446011400009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Globally, however, oysters have precipitously declined in numbers over the last century. To remedy this drastic decrease, many coastal areas have initiated oyster restoration projects. In the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) of Florida, where oyster loss was primarily the result of recreational boat wake dislodgment, researchers have put in place a unique method to supplement natural recruitment of oysters. This method consists of deploying stabilized shell attached to mesh mats. Larval oysters thus have substrate on which to settle and three-dimensional reef habitats have been reestablished in historical footprints. This restoration project has proven to be successful, shown by 9 years of data collection on growth, recruitment, and survivability. In this study, we sought to determine the length of time required for newly restored oyster reefs to reach equivalent levels of genetic diversity as undisturbed, natural (reference) oyster reefs. Additionally, we determined if recreational harvesting impacted the genetic diversity of these reference reefs. Using nine microsatellite loci, we found that restored oyster reefs accumulated as much genetic diversity as natural reefs as quickly as 1 month after stabilized shells were deployed. We likewise found that harvesting did not impact genetic diversity in oyster reefs in the IRL. These results are encouraging, and are a valuable addition to understanding the importance of oyster reef restoration on the ecosystem.","2018-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"943-951",NA,"5","26",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000443586200017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is well established that habitat restoration results in higher finfish biomass and diversity where oyster reefs replace bare substrata. Therefore, restoring oyster reefs with a view to also improving fish stocks is often a key goal of oyster restoration. However, the principles of habitat quality, ecological connectivity and broader ecosystem management are poorly integrated within oyster reef restoration ecology, but such principles may be instructive in enhancing the benefits of projects on fish populations throughout estuarine seascapes. This manuscript presents a framework for projects seeking to restore both oyster reef habitat and finfish communities. Structurally and biologically complex oyster reefs, comprising both oysters and other invertebrates, are required to provide shelter, food and nursery services to fish. By carefully considering site selection at seascape scales (km to 10s of km), restoration can enhance the network of habitat available to fish and potentially increase the overall carrying capacity of the estuary. Managers of estuaries that now include restored oyster reefs should implement fisheries management plans and consider the effects of management actions broadly throughout catchments; failing to do so may jeopardize gains in fish yields. Management decisions must be adaptable, responding to key criteria in thorough monitoring programs. Integrating these ecological and coastal management concepts into oyster reef restoration will enhance outcomes for fishes and increase stakeholder engagement and cost-effectiveness.","2018-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"931-947",NA,"5","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000443114900013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster populations have declined dramatically due to overharvesting, habitat loss, and disease. As restoration efforts and aquaculture of oysters continue to increase throughout their range, it is important to consider the impacts of a number of potential oyster pests, including the boring sponge Cliona spp. and the pea crab Zaops (Pinnotheres) ostreum, on oyster populations. Both of these have been demonstrated to reduce oyster growth, condition, and in some instances, reproductive output. Boring sponges in particular are a major concern for oyster growers and managers. Our monitoring efforts have suggested that pea crabs might be more prevalent in sponge-infested oysters; we therefore conducted an observational study to determine if there was any relationship between pea crab prevalence and sponge presence, and to examine whether the presence of both pests had synergistic effects on oyster condition. At 2 very different sample sites, North Carolina and New Jersey, oysters with 1 pest (i.e. boring sponge) were significantly more likely to have the second pest (i.e. pea crab) than the background population. Furthermore, sponge presence negatively affected oyster condition in North Carolina only, while pea crabs significantly reduced condition at both locations. When sponges and pea crabs were present together, the effects on oyster condition were additive. This study provides further evidence that interactions between an individual and a fouling/pest organism can alter oyster susceptibility to other parasites.","8/28/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"25-36",NA,"1","130",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446368500003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oyster densities of the 3 reefs were 350, 295, and 186 oysters m(-2). Mean summer values of nighttime oxygen flux (FluxDARK) were -488,-428,-300, and-56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) over the natural reef, 2 restoration reefs, and mudflat, respectively. All 4 sites had smaller daytime vs. nighttime oxygen uptake, with mean summer differences between FluxDARK and FluxLIGHT of 360, 250, 239, and 27 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Light was an important short-term driver of daytime reef oxygen flux due to its effect on microalgal photosynthesis. All 3 oyster reefs were significantly heterotrophic, with summer net ecosystem metabolism values ranging from -157 to -298 mmol m(-2) d(-1). FluxDARK values were similar across the 3 reefs when normalized by density, with values between -1.8 and -2.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) oyster(-1). This study represents the most detailed measurements to date of in situ oyster reef oxygen flux, and shows that benthic microalgae can significantly impact reef oxygen dynamics. FluxDARK values scale with oyster density, and consequently can be used as a metric for reef restoration success.","7/12/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"75-91",NA,"","599",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000440371600006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The existence of this threshold, which can often be a complex, multi-dimensional surface, rather than a single point, is of particular importance in degraded populations for which there is a desire for successful restoration. Here, we incorporated positive density dependence into a closed, size- and age-structured integral projection model parameterized with empirical data from an eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, population in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. To understand the properties of the threshold surface, and implications for restoration, we introduced a general method based on a linearization of the threshold surface at its unique, unstable equilibrium. We estimated the number of oysters of a particular age (i.e., stock enhancement), or the surface area of dead shell substrate required (i.e., habitat enhancement) to move a population from an extinction trajectory to a persistence trajectory. The location of the threshold surface was strongly affected by changes in the amount of local larval retention. Traditional stock enhancement with oysters <1 yr old (i.e., spat) required three times as many oysters relative to stock enhancement with oysters between ages 3 and 7yr old, while the success of habitat enhancement depended upon the initial size distribution of the population. The methodology described here demonstrates the importance of considering positive density dependence in oyster populations, and also provides insights into effective management and restoration strategies when dealing with a high dimensional threshold separating extinction and persistence.","2018-06","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"897-909",NA,"4","28",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000434092200004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to the complex structure of subtidal oyster reefs, one effective and efficient means to sample is by patent tongs, rather than SCUBA, dredges, or bottom cores. Restored reefs vary in relief and oyster density, either of which could affect survey efficiency. This study is the first to evaluate gear (the first full grab) and survey (which includes selecting a specific half portion of the first grab for further processing) efficiencies of hand-operated patent tongs as a function of reef height and oyster density on subtidal restoration reefs. In the Great Wicomico River, a tributary of lower Chesapeake Bay, restored reefs of high-and low-relief (25 +/- 45 cm, and 8 +/- 12 cm, respectively) were constructed throughout the river as the first large-scale oyster sanctuary reef restoration effort (sanctuary acreage > 20 ha at one site) in Chesapeake Bay. We designed a metal frame to guide a non-hydraulic mechanical patent tong repeatedly into the same plot on a restored reef until all oysters within the grab area were captured. Full capture was verified by an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. Samples (n = 19) were taken on nine different reefs, including five low-(n = 8) and four high-relief reefs (n = 11), over a two-year period. The gear efficiency of the patent tong was estimated to be 76% (+/- 5% standard error), whereas survey efficiency increased to 81% (+/- 10%) due to processing. Neither efficiency differed significantly between young-of-the-year oysters (spat) and adults, high-and low-relief reefs, or years. As this type of patent tong is a common and cost-effective tool to evaluate oyster restoration projects as well as population density on fished habitat, knowing the gear and survey efficiencies allows for accurate and precise population estimates.","5/2/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e0196725",NA,"5","13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000431281900074",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Successful restoration is a byproduct of several factors, including physical and biological processes, as well as permitting and logistical considerations. Rarely are factors from all of these categories included in HSI models, despite their combined relevance to common restoration goals such as population persistence. We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based HSI for restoring persistent high-relief subtidal oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs protected from harvest (i.e., sanctuaries) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. Expert stakeholder input identified 17 factors to include in the HSI. Factors primarily represented physical (e.g., salinity) and biological (e.g., larval dispersal) processes relevant to oyster restoration, but also included several relevant permitting (e.g., presence of seagrasses) and logistical (e.g., distance to restoration material stockpile sites) considerations. We validated the model with multiple years of oyster density data from existing sanctuaries, and compared HSI output with distributions of oyster reefs from the late 1800's. Of the 17 factors included in the model, stakeholders identified four factors-salinity, larval export from existing oyster sanctuaries, larval import to existing sanctuaries, and dissolved oxygen-most critical to oyster sanctuary site selection. The HSI model provided a quantitative scale over which a vast water body (similar to 6,000 km(2)) was narrowed down by 95% to a much smaller suite of optimal (top 1% HSI) and suitable (top 5% HSI) locations for oyster restoration. Optimal and suitable restoration locations were clustered in northeast and southwest Pamlico Sound. Oyster density in existing sanctuaries, normalized for time since reef restoration, was a positive exponential function of HSI, providing validation for the model. Only a small portion (10-20%) of historical reef locations overlapped with current, model-predicted optimal and suitable restoration habitat. We contend that stronger linkages between larval connectivity, landscape ecology, stakeholder engagement and spatial planning within HSI models can provide a more holistic, unified approach to restoration.","4/4/18","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"UNSP 76",NA,"","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457075000001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we characterize the boat wake climate in the Intracoastal Waterway, assess the bathymetry in this heavily trafficked area, and anticipate the effects of experimental living shorelines (natural breakwall and oyster restoration structures) on facilitating sediment deposition and slowing vegetation retreat. Field observations indicate that boat wakes suspend nearshore sediment and can reach heights greater than 40 cm. A numerical stability model of the breakwalls suggests that the optimal porosity is field-specific. The desired porosity for minimizing lateral displacement is 0.50, while it is 0.18 for maximum energy dissipation, which indicates a need to further investigate this complex problem.

By studying Pleistocene fossil oyster assemblages, it is possible to reconstruct baseline conditions and develop recommendations for oyster mitigation. Fossil assemblages were studied from five Pleistocene sites located in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Reconstructions of paleosalinity and temperature were used to identify modern and colonial sites with similar environmental parameters for comparison. Shell height and life span in Chesapeake Bay oysters declined significantly from the Pleistocene to today, at the same time that ontogenetic growth rates have increased. This pattern is driven by age truncation, in which both harvesting and disease preferentially remove the larger, reproductively more active and primarily female members of the population. By contrast, Pleistocene oysters from North Carolina did not differ significantly, in shell height, life span, or growth rates, from modern oysters. Although oyster management in the Mid-Atlantic States has focused historically on protecting and supplementing early life stages, this study recommends three potential management solutions to the age truncation revealed by comparison with Pleistocene oysters.

However, by processing nutrients and organic material from the water column, the culture of many suspension-feeding bivalves has been proposed as a novel solution toward mitigating problems facing coastal water quality, including the removal of disease-causing parasites. Here we developed and simulated an epidemiological model describing sympatric oyster Crassostrea virginica populations in aquaculture and the wild impacted by the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus. Our model captured the indirect interaction between wild and cultured populations that occurs through sharing water-borne P. marinus transmission stages, and we hypothesized that oyster aquaculture can enhance wild oyster populations through reduced parasitism as long as cultured oysters are harvested prior to spreading disease. We found that the density of oysters in aquaculture, which is commonly thought to lead to the spread of disease through farms and out to nearby populations in the wild, has only indirect effects on P. marinus transmission through its interaction with the rate of aquaculture harvests. Sufficient aquaculture harvest, which varies with the susceptibility of farmed oysters to P. marinus infection and their lifespan once infected, reduces disease by diluting parasites in the environment. Our modeling results offer new insights toward the broader epidemiological implications of oyster aquaculture and effective disease management.","2018","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"557-567",NA,"","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454301700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bivalves impact nutrient cycling, create and modify habitat, and affect food webs directly (i.e., prey) and indirectly (i.e., movement of nutrients and energy).

Water column chlorophyll a concentrations and crab behavior were measured over the duration of the experiment. Predation risk had no effect on oyster reef drawdown of chlorophyll a, which suggests that this important ecosystem function of oyster reefs is not mediated by behaviorally induced predator effects.

The results demonstrate that the optimal combination of temperature and salinity where Louisiana oysters experience reduced mortality and fast growth rates is skewed toward lower salinities and higher water temperatures than previous models have suggested. Outside of that optimal range, oysters are commonly exposed to combinations of temperature and salinity that are correlated with highmortality and reduced growth. How these combinations affect growth, and to a lesser degree mortality, appears to be size class dependent.

Intertidal habitats must maintain their surface elevations with respect to sea level to persist via vertical growth or landward retreat, but projected rates of sea-level rise may exceed the accretion rates of many biogenic habitats. While considerable attention is focused on climate change over centennial timescales, relative sea level also fluctuates dramatically (10-30cm) over month-to-year timescales due to interacting oceanic and atmospheric processes. To assess the response of oyster-reef (Crassostrea virginica) growth to interannual variations in mean sea level (MSL) and improve long-term forecasts of reef response to rising seas, we monitored the morphology of constructed and natural intertidal reefs over 5years using terrestrial lidar. Timing of reef scans created distinct periods of high and low relative water level for decade-old reefs (n=3) constructed in 1997 and 2000, young reefs (n=11) constructed in 2011 and one natural reef (approximately 100years old). Changes in surface elevation were related to MSL trends. Decade-old reefs achieved 2cm/year growth, which occurred along higher elevations when MSL increased. Young reefs experienced peak growth (6.7cm/year) at a lower elevation that coincided with a drop in MSL. The natural reef exhibited considerable loss during the low MSL of the first time step but grew substantially during higher MSL through the second time step, with growth peaking (4.3cm/year) at MSL, reoccupying the elevations previously lost. Oyster reefs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium with short-term (month-to-year) fluctuations in sea level, evidencing notable resilience to future changes to sea level that surpasses other coastal biogenic habitat types. These growth patterns support the presence of a previously defined optimal growth zone that shifts correspondingly with changes in MSL, which can help guide oyster-reef conservation and restoration.","2017-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"10409-10420",NA,"23","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000417754100045",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reefs higher than 0.3 m supported greater oyster density, survival, and reef complexity, whereas sediment deposition was reduced. Reefs lower than 0.3 m experienced heavy sediment deposition and were eventually buried.

If antibiotics impact fish as they do mice and humans, prophylactic administrations on aquaculture farms may increase downstream disease susceptibility in target hosts, despite short-term pathogen control benefits. We tested the effects of antibiotics on mortality after a pathogen challenge in the Poecilia sphenops black molly and subsequently tested if probiotic inoculations could reverse any antibiotic-induced losses of disease resistance. We found that antibiotic treatment significantly increased fish mortality. We further found that our two candidate probiotic bacterial species, Phaeobacter inhibens S4Sm and Bacillus pumilus RI06-95Sm, were able to colonize black molly microbiomes and reverse the negative impacts of antibiotics. Despite the positive impact on survival, probiotic treatment did not influence overall microbiome community structure or diversity. Our results suggest that subtle manipulations of microbiome composition can have dramatic impacts on host phenotype. The results of this study have implications for how antibiotic-treated microbiomes can be restored and suggest that small-scale additions may be as effective as wholesale transplants.

If antibiotics impact fish as they do mice and humans, prophylactic administrations in aquaculture and ornamental fish farms may increase downstream disease susceptibility in target hosts, despite short-term pathogen control benefits. Recent research has suggested that their use exacerbates bacterial outbreaks by creating sterile, nutrient-rich environments for invading pathogens to colonize and could help to explain rising economic costs of bacterial outbreaks in aquaculture.

We tested the hypothesis that fouling by boring sponges will change the interaction strength between oysters and a common predator (stone crabs). We generated five oyster density treatments crossed with two sponge treatments (sponge and no sponge). We contrasted the interaction strength between stone crabs and fouled and non-fouled oysters by comparing the parameters of fitted functional response curves based on Rogers random predation model. We found that fouled oysters suffered higher predation from stone crabs, and that the increased predation risk stemmed from a reduction in the handling time needed to consume the fouled oysters. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the effects of abiotic changes on both the composition of ecological communities, and on the strengths of direct and indirect interactions among species.

Over 2 years (2011-2012), we evaluated naturally occurring fringing and patch intertidal oyster reefs in southeastern North Carolina, USA, to determine how varied reef type, size, and distance from edge to interior influenced the associated benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton. In addition, the effects of size and edge vs. interior were examined on constructed intertidal reefs at 2 different locations. On the natural reefs, species richness of benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton were significantly increased on fringing reefs. Benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased on large natural reefs, whereas mobile nekton richness significantly increased off of large reefs. Further, associated benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased along the reef edge, whereas mobile nekton diversity increased along the reef/open bottom interface. Species richness and densities for benthic macrofauna increased with created reef size, while there was greater species richness and diversity and dissimilar communities for mobile nekton along constructed reef edges. Habitat specificity may influence utilization for mobile nekton, as resident organisms with limited vagility had a stronger response to habitat characteristics. Thus, utilization of intertidal oyster reefs can be highly structured by habitat characteristics on many scales, and should be considered when examining species interactions, ecosystem management, and future restoration efforts.","10/13/17","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"57-70",NA,"","581",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000414582700005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Active settlement, passive settlement, and flow around these concavity treatments were examined. In addition, settlement on oyster shell cultch presented in different surface orientations, and either zip-tied to open mats, or packed in mesh bags, was examined. Results indicate that concavity can affect settlement success (W: D ratio of 5 resulted in the highest settlement success under this study's conditions). Examination of flow rates and patterns suggests that water movement over W: D 5 treatments delivers larvae to the settlement surface, but active attachment behavior is required to explain W: D 5's higher settlement densities relative to W:D 2. The highest settlement occurred with open mats on surfaces oriented horizontally and facing downward. Comparisons of mat, bag, and orientation results suggest that optimal current range for settlement is between 0.3 and 2.0 cm/sec.

Created reef success depends entirely on selecting a location that supports long-term oyster growth and survival, including the recruitment and survival of on-reef oysters. Significant changes in estuarine salinity through management of freshwater inflows and through changed precipitation patterns may significantly impact the locations of optimal oyster restoration sites. These rapid shifts in conditions necessitate a need to better understand both impacts to on-reef oyster growth and population development, and variation in oyster stock performance. Oyster growth, mortality, condition, and disease prevalence were examined in three different stocks of oysters located in protected cages, as well as oyster recruitment and mortality on experimental reef units in three different locations representing a salinity gradient, along the Louisiana Gulf coast in 2011 and 2012. Over a 2-y period, the high-salinity site had highest oyster growth rate in protected cages but demonstrated the least likelihood for reef development based on on-reef oyster population failure, likely because of predation-related mortality (high recruitment and 100% mortality). In contrast, the midsalinity site with moderate oyster growth and on-reef recruitment and low mortality demonstrated a higher likelihood for reef development. The lowest salinity site exhibited extreme variability in all oyster responses between years because of extreme variation in environmental conditions during the study, indicating a low likelihood of long-term reef development. Whereas limited differences in stock performance between sites were found, the range of site environmental conditions tested was ultimately much lower than expected and may not have provided a wide enough range of conditions. In areas with limited, low recruitment, or rapidly changing environmental conditions, seeding with stocks selected for best growth and survival under expected future environmental conditions could better ensure reef development by using oyster populations best suited to the predicted conditions. With rapidly changing estuarine conditions from anthropogenic activities and climate change, siting of oyster reef restoration incorporating both oyster population dynamics and in situ biotic and abiotic interactions is critical in better directing site selection for reef restoration efforts.","2017-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"341-351",NA,"2","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000408958300006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthering our understanding of how these habitats are evolving in the face of anthropogenic and climate driven changes will help improve management strategies. Previous work has shown that the growth and productivity of both oyster reefs and salt marshes are strongly linked to elevation in the intertidal zone (duration of aerial exposure). We build on that research by examining the growth of marsh-fringing oyster reefs at yearly to decadal time scales and examine movement of the boundary between oyster reef and salt marsh at decadal to centennial time scales. We show that the growth of marsh-fringing reefs is strongly associated to the duration of aerial exposure, with little growth occurring below mean low water and above mean sea level. Marsh-shoreline movement, in the presence or absence of fringing oyster reefs, was reconstructed using transects of sediment cores. Carbonaceous marsh sediments sampled below the modern fringing oyster reefs indicate that marsh shorelines within Back Sound, North Carolina are predominantly in a state of transgression (landward retreat), and modern oyster-reef locations were previously occupied by salt marsh within the past two centuries. Cores fronting transgressive marsh shorelines absent fringing reefs sampled thinner and less extensive carbonaceous marsh sediment than at sites with fringing reefs. This indicates that fringing reefs are preserving carbonaceous marsh sediment from total erosion as they transgress and colonize the exposed marsh shoreline making marsh sediments more resistant to erosion. The amount of marsh sediment preservation underneath the reef scales with the reef's relief, as reefs with the greatest relief were level with the marsh platform, preserving a maximum amount of carbonaceous sediments during transgression by buffering the marsh from erosional processes. Thus, fringing oyster reefs not only have the capacity to shelter shorelines but, if located at the ideal tidal elevation, they also keep up with accelerating sea-level rise and cap carbonaceous sediments, protecting them from erosion, as reefs develop along the marsh.","2017-07","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1013-1027",NA,"4","40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000402100700007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To assess the potential impact of green crabs on oyster mortality in relation to predator and prey size, we conducted multiple predator-prey manipulations in the field and laboratory. The surveys confirmed an ongoing green crab spread into new productive oyster habitats while rapidly increasing in numbers in areas where crabs had established already. The experiments measured mortality rates on four sizes of oysters exposed to three sizes of crab, and lasted 3-5 days. The outcomes of experiments conducted in Vexar bags, laboratory tanks and field cages were consistent and were heavily dependent on both crab size and oyster size: while little predation occurred on large oysters, large and medium green crabs preyed heavily on small sizes. Oysters reached a refuge within the 35-55 mm shell length range; below that range, oysters suffered high mortality due to green crab predation and thus require management measures to enhance their survival.

The physical reef structure and associated biotic parameters can affect the availability of food resources for oysters. Oysters and potential composite food sources - suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) - were assessed using a dual stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) approach at three reef types (natural, restored, and unconsolidated) seasonally for two years to determine if changes in physical and/or biotic parameters affected the relative availability and/or use of food resources by oysters. SPOM was more depleted in C-13 (-24.2 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, mean +/- SD) than SSOM (-21.2 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand). SPOM composition is likely dominated by autochthonous phytoplankton production, while SSOM includes trapped phytoplankton and benthic microalgae. SSOM was used by oysters in increasing proportions relative to SPOM over time at all reef types. This temporal trend is likely due to increased oyster biomass over time, promoting enhanced microphytobenthos growth through feedback effects related to oyster biodeposits. Structural differences between reef types observed in this study had no effect on food resource availability and use by oysters, indicating strong bentho-pelagic coupling likely due to shallow depths as well as strong and consistent winds. This study provides insights for restoration of oyster reefs as it highlights that food resources used by oysters remain similar among reef types despite changes in abiotic and biotic parameters among habitats and over time.

Further complicating the issue, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence are also expected to affect estuarine water quality. In this study, we developed a process-based numerical modeling system that couples hydrodynamic, water quality, and oyster population dynamics. We selected Breton Sound Estuary (BSE) (similar to 2740 km(2)) in the eastern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain since it is home to several of the largest public oyster seed grounds and private leases for the Gulf coast. The coupled oyster population model was calibrated and validated against field observed oyster growth data. We predicted the responses of oyster population in BSE to small-(142 m(3) s(-1)) and large-scale (7080 m(3) s(-1)) river diversions at the Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure planned in the 2012 Coastal Master Plan (Louisiana) under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative sea-level rise (RSLR=eustatic SLR+subsidence) compared to a baseline condition (Year 2009). Model results showed that the large-scale diversion had a stronger negative impact on oyster population dynamics via freshening of the entire estuary, resulting in reduced oyster growth rate and production than RSLR. Under the large-scale diversion, areas with optimal oyster growth rates (>15 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) oyster(-1) wk(-1)) and production (>500 g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)) would shift seaward to the southeastern edge of the estuary, turning the estuary into a very low oyster production system. RSLR however played a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of oyster growth rate and production. RSLR would result in an overall estuary-wide decrease in oyster growth rate and production as a consequence of decreased salinities in the middle and lower estuary because rising sea level likely causes increased stage and overbank flow downstream along the lower Mississippi River.

Additionally, the influences of distance from edge to interior locations and habitat patch size were examined for oyster populations on 3 size classes of created intertidal reefs at 2 locations. The habitat characteristics examined significantly influenced oyster populations, with increased densities towards interior locations on a reef, a trend of overall higher densities on intermediate sized reefs, significantly greater densities on natural patch reefs compared to natural fringing reefs. Density and recruitment patterns suggested differences between edge and interior locations. However, other population characteristics, such as oyster condition and shell height, indicated there may be ecological trade-offs among the habitat characteristics examined.

Restored oyster reefs are intended to provide substrata for sessile hard-fouling organisms such as barnacles, but the optimal configuration to encourage larval settlement has not yet been determined. Two common restoration strategies involve cultch, the shell material for reef restoration, in bags or on mats. Bags constitute quick, stackable construction with cultch packed haphazardly and limited space between shells. Mats utilize cultch sparingly and keep shells more exposed to currents. Although both restoration strategies are widely used, data comparing larval settlement between bags and mats are unavailable. We followed daily larval supply of the ivory barnacle Balanus eburneus (Gould, 1841) and corresponding settlement on cultch presented in bags and mats in a field study lasting one month in an estuary in eastern Florida, USA.

Recruitment densities of B. eburneus were as great as 7.6 +/- 0.54 SE individuals cm (2), and higher on mats than in bags (P = 0.0001).

Barnacles settling in late spring had larger basal diameters but relatively shorter feeding appendages in windward areas, compared to leeward areas; these morphological differences mirrored ADV measurements, verified long-term differences in flow and were indicative of bigger waves and higher flow velocities in windward locations. Thus, oyster reefs can reduce wave height and slow current velocity and influence the diversity, abundance, and morphology of associated species. The decrease in wave height can provide shoreline protection, an ecosystem service of oyster reefs often mentioned but rarely measured.","4/7/17","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"25-36",NA,"","569",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000400344700003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These highly productive, physically demanding ecosystems are populated by core species groups that often have strong trophic interactions with implications for ecosystem function and service provision. Positive interactions occur between ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) and cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Mussels transfer particulate nitrogen from the water column to the marsh sediments, which stimulates cordgrass growth, and cordgrass provides predator and/or heat stress refuge for mussels. Here, we test mussel facilitation of two functions in salt marshes that relate to N removal: microbial denitrification and water filtration. Microcosm experiments revealed that the highest rates of N-2 production and nitrification occurred when mussels were present with marsh vegetation, suggesting that mussels enhanced coupling of the nitrification-denitrification. Surveys spanning the York River Estuary, Chesapeake Bay, showed that the highest densities of mussels occurred in the first meter for all marsh types with mainstem fringing (1207 +/- 265 mussels/m(2)) being the most densely populated. The mussel population was estimated to be similar to 197 million animals with a water filtration potential of 90-135 million L/hr. Erosion simulation models demonstrated that suitable marsh habitat for ribbed mussels along the York River Estuary would be reduced by 11.8% after 50 years. This reduction in mussel habitat resulted in a projected 15% reduction in ribbed mussel abundance and filtration capacity. Denitrification potential was reduced in conjunction with projected marsh loss (35,536 m(2)) by 205 g N/hr, a 16% reduction. Because of the predominant occurrence of ribbed mussels at the marsh seaward edge and because the highest proportional loss will occur for fringing marshes (20%), shoreline management practices that restore or create fringing marsh may help offset these projected losses.","2017-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"e01795",NA,"4","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000400985300041",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Effective restoration requires an understanding of the distribution, density, and demographic rates (growth and survival) of oysters inhabiting existing natural reefs and how these may vary as a function of landscape-scale factors, such as tidal range and fetch distances. Furthermore, natural intertidal habitats are increasingly being replaced with hardened shoreline structures that may be colonized by oysters, yet little is known about habitat quality (as indexed by oyster density and demographic rates) of these hardened structures relative to natural habitats. The present study sought to compare oyster density, demographic rates, and population estimates (1) across estuarine landscape settings to inform natural intertidal oyster reef restoration (i. e., comparing natural intertidal reefs within adjacent water bodies that vary in tidal regimes and fetch distances) and (2) across natural habitats and human-made structures to assess variation in habitat quality between natural reefs and hardened shorelines. Oyster density, growth rates, and population estimates on natural intertidal reefs were greatest within the smaller, more tidally influenced Core Sound versus the larger, wind-driven Pamlico Sound, with no significant difference in survivorship identified between the two water bodies. Natural intertidal reefs and hardened shoreline structures were compared within Pamlico Sound only, with natural intertidal reefs hosting three to eight times higher oyster densities than hardened shoreline structures. When mean oyster density/ m 2 was multiplied by reef area to estimate population size, natural intertidal reefs within Pamlico Sound hosted considerably greater populations of oysters relative to hardened shorelines. The present study fills an existing need to understand oyster density and demographic rates on natural intertidal reefs and hardened shorelines to better inform future restoration and shoreline management scenarios.","2017-04","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"87-100",NA,"1","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000399114600011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an attempt to understand the interaction between bivalve physiology and environmental conditions, filter-feeding assays were carried out in a shallow estuary, the Indian River Lagoon (IRL; Florida, USA). The feeding behavior of the bivalves was studied using in situ filter-feeding devices and the biodeposition method in the 3 basins of the IRL during March and August 2015. Water characteristics (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chl a, and total, organic, and inorganic particulates) were related to possible changes in the feeding physiology of the bivalves. Oysters had higher clearance rates, filtration rates, and rejection than clams. The high rejection of inorganic matter allowed oysters to increase the organic matter ingested, leading to high absorption efficiencies. In contrast, because clam rejection was low regardless of elevated levels of inorganic matter, their absorption efficiency only increased with higher organic matter content. Both species preferred higher salinities, and the amount of organic matter in the water had a negative relationship with some feeding parameters (filtration rate for both species, and rejection for oysters). Acute environ mental change brought about by a brown tide (caused by the alga Aureoumbra lagunensis) also affected these 2 bivalve species differently, supporting the hypothesis that oysters and clams have different physiological capabilities that drive their ability to survive in dynamic estuarine ecosystems.","3/13/17","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"125-137",NA,"","567",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000397823100009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present study characterized the role of wave exposure in determining the distribution of natural intertidal oyster reefs and of oysters on hardened shorelines (bulkhead and riprap revetments). Wave exposure was determined using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-developed Wave Exposure Model (WEMo), which integrates adjacent water depth, fetch, and processed wind information, among other variables.

Hardened shorelines and associated oyster densities were mapped for Pamlico Sound only. A narrow wave exposure threshold (similar to 500 J m(-1)) was identified above which natural intertidal reefs did not occur and below which reef presence was apparently dependent on other structuring variables, such as salinity at the time of sampling and the grain size of surrounding sediments.

We compared the development of a restored subtidal oyster reef to that of a natural reef for 29 months by assessing (1) community metrics (e.g., biomass, diversity), (2) the stable isotope composition of food sources and consumers, and ( 3) biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices. A clear shift in restored reef community composition occurred 12-15 months after restoration, moving from a community dominated by opportunistic species to a more diverse and evenly distributed community, similar to that of the natural reef. Consumer stable isotope values indicated that the restored reef community was supported by similar food resources and had similar food chain length as the natural reef community by 5-month post-restoration. However, biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices indicated that the magnitude of the main trophic pathways and characteristics of food web complexity in the restored reef did not recover to natural reef levels until 12-15 months after construction. The functional recovery of the restored reef community was driven by the homogenization of biomass distribution among trophic compartments as oysters and top predators increasingly colonized the reef. Results indicate that oyster reef restoration can support food web functions like those provided by natural reefs. We also demonstrate the importance of combining food web and community structure information in the study of ecological functioning.","2017-03","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"54",NA,"3","164",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000395180300017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in this economically valuable and ecologically important species.

Condition varied across oyster cohorts: Offspring of northern populations had better condition than offspring from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the southeastern Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and condition, yet offspring from local broodstock do not have higher survival or growth than those from farther away.

Oyster sampling units (OSUs) were deployed within intertidal oyster reef, and modified throw traps were used to collect macrofauna inhabiting the OSU and other adjacent vegetated habitats. Habitat arrangement and proximity as it relates to macrofaunal density, species richness, and community composition were also evaluated by comparing communities in oyster reef within the oyster reef complex, oyster reef adjacent to a seagrass complex, and oyster reef adjacent to marsh edge. Higher macrofaunal densities and species richness were observed within oyster reefs compared to seagrass and marsh edge. Oyster reef also supported a distinct community, while seagrass and marsh shared similar species composition and richness. The highest densities of macrofauna were collected on oyster reefs near seagrass and oyster reef located within the oyster reef complex. These results indicate the importance of intertidal oyster reefs to macrofauna and that reef location within the estuarine mosaic influences density and community assemblages.

Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions.

For reef-building oysters, reefs are maintained through accumulation of shell material, which depends on recruitment and growth and which provides substrate for new generations. Knowledge of the fundamental niche of oysters in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions helps define the area where ecosystem engineers grow and survive well and where their structures are likely to persist and be effective for coastal protection. Response curves of different life-history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated along a tidal emersion gradient in a manipulative field study. Density of juvenile oysters was maximal around 36% tidal emersion. Shell growth of juveniles and adults, condition index (CI) of adults and mortality of adults were negatively related to tidal emersion, whereas mortality of juveniles was positively related to tidal emersion. Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40% tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40% tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.","12/29/16","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"113-122",NA,"","562",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000394183600009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Resident mesopredators such as the xanthid mud crabs are abundant (>200/m(2)) on constructed subtidal oyster reefs in the New York metropolitan region and may contribute to post-settlement oyster mortality. Two study sites with differing mesopredator species, Hastings and Soundview Park, were selected to examine the role of small crustacean predators in post settlement mortality. The white-fingered mud crab (Rhithropanopeus horrisii) inhabits Hastings, whereas the flat mud crab (Eurvpanopeus depressus) and Sayi niud crab (Dyspanopeus sari) inhabit Soundview Park. Using size-selective mesh cages to exclude predators, the effects of predator size on oyster predation and recruitment at Hastings and Soundview Park were examined. Overall, Sound view Park had higher consumption rates than Hastings. The highest consumption at Soundview Park occurred when predators of all sizes had access to the oyster prey. Larger-sized predators were likely responsible for oyster mortality, as oyster mortality was not different between the mesopredator and no-predator treatment at Soundview Park. Few oysters recruited at Soundview Park: thus predator size effects on oyster recruitment could not be effectively evaluated between sites. Recruitment at Hastings was not affected by predator-exclusion treatments, in agreement with the oyster predation experiments. Though abundant, no mud crab mesopredator recovered at either site was greater than 22 mm in carapace width. Mesopredators were likely not of sufficient size to be dominant predators of newly settled juvenile oysters at Hastings and Soundview Park. Instead, predation pressure at Soundview Park was likely due to larger mobile predators such as blue (Callinccics sapidus) and spider crabs (Libinia spp.). Mesopredator size is an important factor to consider when evaluating mesopredator roles on oyster reefs.","2016-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"801-807",NA,"4","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398959000008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, findings of a key 1992 paper on Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery data and Apalachicola River discharge data from 1960 to 1984 were recreated, and the analysis extended to 1987 to 2013, to evaluate whether relationships previously reported between river discharge and oyster fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) persist. The originally reported relationship between low river discharge and lower oyster landings 2 y later was confirmed, but when these same relationships for data from 1987 to 2013 were examined, correlation coefficients relating river discharge metrics to oyster fishery CPUE that were significant with 1960 to 1984 data did not persist with data from 1987 to 2013. Combining all available data (1960 to 2013, excluding 1985 to 1986), previously reported significant correlation coefficients were found to have generally persisted or strengthened and the total number of significant correlations increased. A surprising result is the general lack of association between river discharge and oyster fishery landings from 1987 to 2013, a period of frequent drought and generally lower annual river discharge compared with 1960 to 1984. There are multiple possible explanations for the observed relationships between river discharge and oyster fishery landings including ( l) counterintuitive changes in oyster fishery landings due to a change in reporting requirements between the two epochs, (2) hyperstable relationship between oyster abundance and fishery CPI; E, (3) failure of the Apalachicola Bay oyster population to recover after Hurricane Elena, and (4) ecosystem changes possibly related to nonstationary river discharge levels altering Apalachicola River or Bay ecosystem dynamics in unknown ways. The absence of simple relationships between freshwater input and oyster fishery responses complicates ongoing management and restoration decisions for Apalachicola Bay, and this work demonstrates that, even within the same system, the relationship between freshwater discharge and response by a key estuarine ecosystem constituent is uncertain.","2016-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"809-825",NA,"4","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398959000009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To identify suitable areas for oyster restoration and aquaculture, areas of oyster suitable habitat must first be identified. A habitat suitability model is an ideal tool for identifying sites for species restoration. Because it relies on presence-only data, MaxEnt is a particularly useful habitat-suitability model for identifying restoration and species introduction sites. Habitat suitability models rely on the selection of environmental factors, which are assumed to be important for the target species; however, this selection of environmental factors is often arbitrary and there are few existing guidelines. This work applies an oyster habitat suitability model to the St. Louis Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Six environmental factors, namely average salinity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, water depth, minimum dissolved oxygen, and average total suspended solids were chosen to simulate habitat suitability. The environmental factors were obtained from a calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model of the estuary. The habitat suitability model was run with every possible combination of environmental factors, including one, two, three, four, five, and six inputs. Model results showed that at this location, salinity is the most important environmental input. Furthermore, model results showed that increasing the number of inputs optimizes model results. There is a diminishing return on the addition of environmental factors and there is a point at which the continued addition of environmental factors will not continue to notably improve model optimization. The ranges of simulated suitable values for the environmental factors were contextualized within measured values. This study shows how a statistical model can he used to identify restoration locations. It is a particularly compelling methodology because (1) it does not require prior information regarding suitable ranges of environmental factors; (2) it does not require information regarding the level of importance for those environmental factors; (3) it requires presence-only data; (4) results are based on spatiotemporal data at a finer scale than is generally measured in the field: and (5) model results can provide an additional line of evidence that complements knowledge by biologists and oystermen.","2016-12","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"841-849",NA,"4","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398959000012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Though Crassostrea virginica has never been commercially harvested, aboriginal people used the oyster substantially, accumulating middens between 5000 BC and AD 1700. A conservation paleobiological/historical ecological study of oysters from middens and modern reefs within Estero Bay (EB) and Pine Island Sound (PIS) determined if oyster productivity changed due to aboriginal overharvesting. Archaeological samples came from sites including the Late Archaic (LA, 2000-500 BC) of PIS and the Caloosahatchee (Cal, 500 BC-AD 1500) of EB and PIS. These samples were compared with natural oyster death assemblages from neighboring modern reefs. Methods comprised measuring oyster convex valve lengths and sectioning shells to count ligament pit growth lines that served as proxy for growth rate. The biologic taphonomic grade was also compared after scoring the interior valve surface; biologic grade is near pristine for oysters collected live for consumption. Archaeological samples exhibit significantly better taphonomic grades when compared to modern assemblages, confirming the hypothesis that oysters were harvested for food. Valve length decreased significantly from LA to Cal time, whereas modern assemblages were indistinguishable from LA collections. Because the Cal samples span 4 climatic intervals, the results suggest that climate change was not responsible for shifts in productivity. Results support the hypothesis of overharvesting during Cal times. They also suggest that modern oysters retain the capacity for growth, and indicate that aboriginal activity did not result in a permanent microevolutionary shift. The results are also relevant for the ongoing discussion surrounding the creation of an Anthropocene Epoch; the shell middens built throughout history greatly influenced both estuarine ecology and landscapes through fishing and engineering practices.

Oysters deliver material to the sediments through biodeposition and sedimentation caused by modification of flow around the reef. We conducted an experiment to distinguish between biotic effects and physical structure of oyster reefs on sediment nitrogen cycling. Experimental reefs consisting of live oysters, oyster shells alone and mudflats (controls) were sampled for a period of 4 wk for sediment organic matter, C and N content and fluxes of nitrogen (NH4+, NOX and N-2) and oxygen (O-2). We hypothesized that the biological activity of the oyster would deposit more, higher quality organic matter compared to deposition from flow modification alone, thus facilitating denitrification and having a larger impact on sediment nitrogen cycling. Compared to the controls, the live oyster experimental reefs increased sediment denitrification by 61% and the shell experimental reefs showed a 24% increase. The live oyster experimental reef also had the largest O-2 demand and NH4+ production. Reef structure likely increased organic matter deposition, but the higher quality and larger quantity of organic matter associated with live oysters increased denitrification and microbial respiration. This experiment shows that the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal provided by oysters is primarily driven by the biological function of the oysters and secondarily from the physical structure of the reef. Our increased understanding of how oysters engineer ecosystems and modify nutrient cycling can help guide future oyster restoration efforts.","11/24/16","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"173-183",NA,"","560",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000390104900012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nitrification was similar between live oysters and empty oyster shells, however, denitrification was enhanced significantly on living oysters compared to shells.

These distinct morphologies are thought to form by interactions of nascent reef structures with hydrodynamics. We carried out two field studies to determine if historical reef configurations applied in a restoration context would improve reef persistence and restoration outcomes. We collected seabed and water column observations across constructed reefs of three orientations representative of those found historically throughout the oyster's range: parallel or perpendicular to tidal currents or circular. Areas adjacent to reefs were sites of fine sediment trapping, with lower flow velocities, evidence of particle settling, and more fine sediments on the seabed relative to off-reef reference sites. The water column above the reef crest exhibited higher acoustic backscatter, higher flow velocities, and larger particles in suspension, consistent with local erosion of flocculated fine sediment from the reef crest. Perpendicular reefs produced conditions that were more conducive to reef persistence and improved oyster performance, including high flow velocities and enhanced resuspension of sediments from the reef, compared to parallel or circular reefs. Particle trapping in areas between reefs has the potential to inhibit reef growth between existing reef structures, providing support for hypotheses of landscape-scale reef pattern formation. Oyster reef restoration efforts can benefit from this improved understanding of biophysical interactions arising from reef orientation that contribute to sediment dynamics on constructed oyster reefs.","2016-09","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"1435-1448",NA,"5","39",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000380268400010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These die-off events have led to a conversion from shell to sandbar substrate and rapid loss of elevation (ca 8 cm/y). This process appears to be nonreversible, because oyster spat are unable to colonize sandy substrate. It is hypothesized that the addition of durable hard substrate would make reefs more resilient to periodic declines in freshwater flow by providing a persistent settlement site for extant larvae. This article reports a test of the assumption that oyster populations on these reefs are limited by substrate, and documents key effects on oysters, elevation, and avian usage associated with the addition of substrate. Durable substrate was added in the form of limerock cobbles and recycled clam Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758) aquaculture bags filled with cultch, live oysters, and associated fauna to eight paired treatment and control sites spaced along a highly degraded offshore reef chain. Elevation on treatment reefs increased postconstruction by an average of 16 cm. Mean oyster density on treatment sites increased by 2.653x on rock, 14.53x on clam bags, and 9.23x overall compared with control sites. Recycled clam bags contributed approximately 25% of the surface area on treatment reefs, but accounted for 52% of the oysters observed. Oyster densities on treatment sites were between 893 and 1253 those measured at a larger sample of nearby natural reefs, and exceeded the 89th percentile of reported densities at natural and restored reefs in the Gulf of Mexico. Total bird use was higher on treatment sites, but when controlled for elevation, all species but double-crested cormorants [Phalacrocorax auritus (Lesson, 1831)] and bald eagles [Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Linnaeus, 1766)] preferred control (sand bar) sites. These results indicate that (1) oyster recruitment can be strongly limited by available, durable substrate, especially in high-energy environments; (2) aquaculture byproduct materials can play a significant role in the process of restoration; and (3) restoration of oyster reefs and other living shorelines may have impacts on avian community composition. Future research should be aimed at understanding whether durable substrate can also confer longer term resilience to oyster reef communities.","2016-08","3/25/19 20:55","3/25/19 20:55",NA,"359-367",NA,"2","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000383798600010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use.
